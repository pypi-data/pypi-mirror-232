# ChenUtils

## Introduction
ChenUtils is a package used by myself (CodexploRe) to store various packages written by individuals when learning the Python language, mainly created to facilitate the call of modules written by myself.

If you need to use the functionality of some of the modules I wrote, you can jump to the project address of the package containing the corresponding module from the following link, and refer to the README.md file therein, which will help you better use the corresponding module:

[LatestValidProxies](https://gitee.com/CodexploRe/LatestValidProxies)

[Maths](https://gitee.com/CodexploRe/Maths)

In the meantime, you are welcome to visit [my (CodexploRe's) gitee warehouse](https://gitee.com/CodexploRe).

Thank you for your support of this module!
