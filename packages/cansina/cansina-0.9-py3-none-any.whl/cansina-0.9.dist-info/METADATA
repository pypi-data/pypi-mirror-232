Cansina is a Web Content Discovery Application.

It is well known Web applications don't publish all their resources or public links,
so the only way to discover these resources is requesting for them and check the response.

Cansina duty is to help you making requests and filtering and inspecting the responses to tell
apart if it is an existing resource or just an annoying or disguised 404.

Feature requests and comments are welcome.

Cansina is included in [BlackArch Linux](https://www.blackarch.org/), give it a try!

## Speed

Wanna make Cansina run faster? Grab my cup of coffee.

Cansina downloads page content for inspection by default (Yep, Cansina does not racing for speed). but you can disable GET requests and make them HEAD (no body page download). Also, do no print the fancy terminal interface (you will lost some hackish points).

- Put **-H** to make requests lighter
- Put **--no-progress** to print no fancy information in the screen
- Raise default threads to ten with **-t 10** (or even more if you don't mind noise and faulty tries)

## Integrated tree viewer

Cansina integrates a tree viewer (thanks to asciitree package) to output a project sqlite base stored results (http 200 status code by now).

```
./cansina.py -V output/http_testphp.vulnweb.com.sqlite
```

## Windows

Untested in Windows. It should work with **--no-progress**

## Installation

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/deibit/cansina

cd cansina

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From release tagged Py27, Cansina is made with Python 3.x in mind.

[Last version with Python 2.7 support](https://github.com/deibit/cansina/tree/Py27)

## Usage

[Wiki](https://github.com/deibit/cansina/wiki) is full of documentation and examples. But as a fast example:

```
python3 cansina.py -u <site_url> -p <payload_file>
```

Help summary:

```
python3 cansina.py -h
```

## Options

```
usage: cansina.py -u url -p payload [options]
