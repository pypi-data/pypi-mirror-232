pyrcel: cloud parcel model
==========================

![sample parcel model run](docs/figs/model_example.png)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/12927551.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/12927551)[![PyPI Version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrcel.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrcel)[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/darothen/pyrcel/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/darothen/pyrcel/tree/master)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyrcel/badge/?version=stable)](http://pyrcel.readthedocs.org/en/stable/?badge=stable)


This is an implementation of a simple, adiabatic cloud parcel model for use in
aerosol-cloud interaction studies. [Rothenberg and Wang (2016)](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0223.1) discuss the model in detail and its improvements
 and changes over [Nenes et al (2001)][nenes2001]:

* Implementation of κ-Köhler theory for condensation physics ([Petters and
Kreidenweis, 2007)][pk2007]
* Extension of model to handle arbitrary sectional representations of aerosol
populations, based on user-controlled empirical or parameterized size distributions
* Improved, modular numerical framework for integrating the model, including bindings
to several different stiff integrators:
    - `lsoda` - [scipy ODEINT wrapper](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html)
    - `vode, lsode*, lsoda*` - ODEPACK via [odespy][hplgit]
    - `cvode` - SUNDIALS via [Assimulo](http://www.jmodelica.org/assimulo_home/index.html#)

among other details. It also includes a library of droplet activation routines and scripts/notebooks for evaluating those schemes against equivalent calculations done with the parcel model.

Updated code can be found the project [github repository](https://github.com/darothen/pyrcel). If you'd like to use this code or have any questions about it, please [contact the author][author_email]. In particular, if you use this code for research purposes, be sure to carefully read through the model and ensure that you have tweaked/configured it for your purposes (i.e., modifying the accomodation coefficient); other derived quantities).

[Detailed documentation is available](http://pyrcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), including a [scientific description](http://pyrcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sci_descr.html), [installation details](http://pyrcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html), and a [basic example](http://pyrcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/basic_run.html) which produces a figure like the plot at the top of this page.

Requirements
------------

**Required**

* Python >= 3.7
* [numba](http://numba.pydata.org)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) - v0.25+
* [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) - v2023+
* [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/)

**Optional**

The following packages are used for better numerics (ODE solving)

* [Assimulo](http://www.jmodelica.org/assimulo)

The easiest way to satisfy the basic requirements for building and running the
model is to use the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) scientific Python
distribution. Alternatively, a
[miniconda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) is
provided to quickly set-up and get running the model. Assimulo's dependency on
the SUNDIALS library makes it a little bit tougher to install in an automated
fashion, so it has not been included in the automatic setup provided here; you
should refer to [Assimulo's documentation](http://www.jmodelica.org/assimulo_home/installation.html)
for more information on its installation process. Note that many components of
the model and package can be used without Assimulo.

Development
-----------

Please fork this repository if you intend to develop the model further so that the
code's provenance can be maintained.
