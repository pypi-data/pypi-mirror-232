    'long_description': "# iRobot® Education Python® SDK\n\nThis is an installable Python SDK for the iRobot Education robots.\nIt supports the iRobot® Root® rt0, Root® rt1 and Create® 3 educational robots.\n\nThis SDK uses a similar format as Learning Level 3 of the iRobot® Coding App ([code.irobot.com](https://code.irobot.com)) and the iRobot® Python Web Playground ([python.irobot.com](https://python.irobot.com)).\nAs such, it uses async execution and is compatible with Python® 3.9 or greater. MicroPython may work, but it is not tested.\n\nThis SDK is designed to communicate with robots via Bluetooth® Low Energy on Windows®, macOS®, and Linux® systems.\nExperimental backends are provided for communicating over USB serial and USB on MicroPython boards with native USB ports.\nThese are not currently supported.\n\n## Disclaimer: this is a BETA release.\nThe BETA version of the iRobot® Python SDK is provided “as is” to conduct testing and gather user feedback. There is no guarantee on its performance or compatibility, continued availability, or on a timeline for improvements.\n\nPlease do file [issues](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk/issues) as they are found, so that the team (or the community) can address them.\n\n\n## Installation using pip\n\n```\npip3 install irobot_edu_sdk\n```\n\n\n## Optional: Installation from Source\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk.git\n```\n\nFrom the newly cloned SDK's directory, run:\n\n```\npip3 install .\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nA robot object is created from one of the communication backends.\nThis robot object has a number of event callbacks that can be registered and commands that can be sent to the robot.\nAfter a program is setup, the `play()` method will start execution and block until the robot's nose or power button is pressed, the robot is disconnected, or `Ctrl-C` is pressed.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nA good way of getting started is by looking at the examples provided [here](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk/tree/main/examples).\n\nThese examples mirror the iRobot Education [Python Web Playground](http://python.irobot.com).\n\n## Backend\n\n### Bluetooth\n\niRobot Education's robots communicate using a common Bluetooth Low Energy serial protocol, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/root-robot-ble-protocol).\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.bluetooth import Bluetooth\n\n# Connect to robot over Bluetooth Low Energy.\nbackend0 = Bluetooth('') # Connects to the first BLE robot detected.\nbackend1 = Bluetooth('ROOT') # Use robot named 'ROOT'\n```\n\n## ALPHA features\n**The features detailed below are included as ALPHA versions, which provide limited functionality and are likely to contain several known or unknown bugs.**\n**Support is not provided for ALPHA features at this time.**\n\n### Serial\n\nSome Root® robots support a serial port over USB.\nThis feature is currently not available on Create® 3 robots.\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.serial import Serial\n\n# Connect to robot over USB-C cable.\nbackend = Serial('COM1')                          # Windows\nbackend = Serial('/dev/cu.usbmodemRT0123F456789') # macOS\nbackend = Serial('/dev/ttyACM0')                  # Linux\n```\n\n### MicroPython\n\nThis SDK requires MicroPython firmware that includes the `uasyncio` library -- version 1.13 or greater.\nDownload the latest release for your board from http://micropython.org/download.\nThen, copy the `irobot_edu_sdk` directory and all contents to the `PYBFLASH` drive.\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.usb import USB\n\n# Connect to robot from MicroPython-compatible board over USB.\nbackend = USB() # MicroPython-compatible board is powered from USB-C port\n```\n\nNOTE: You may need to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter or a USB-C to micro USB cable.\n\n### Turtle programming model\n\nThis portion of the SDK provides an alternative programming interface to the SDK following the paradigm of \n[turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics).\nIt provides a limited, simplified, and synchronous interface to the in the spirit (and largely the syntax) of the \n[Python® turtle.Turtle class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).\nIt can be used on any robot supported by the SDK, using any supported backend. See the `README.md` file and other\nexample files in the `examples_turtle/` directory for more information.\n\n## Additional information\n\n**© 2022-2023 iRobot Corporation.
