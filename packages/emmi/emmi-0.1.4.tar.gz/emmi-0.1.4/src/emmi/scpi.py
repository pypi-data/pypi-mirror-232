class PropertyNodeSlot:
        ''' Wrapper to access a sub-structure of a PropertyNode value.

        See documentation to `PropertyNode` about what it does and how it's
        structure first.

        Some property nodes have multiple values -- "arrays". When the
        parsing format strings contain named values (e.g. "{foo:d}, {bar:s}"),
        we're using the designated variable names to expose the corresponding
        part of `parse.Result` as a read-only namespace object.

        This class implements one specific part of this functionality by
        restricting the `.get()` answer to a specific key. The writing
        ability is removed.

        FIXME: not sure this is a good idea. This would enable higher-layers
        to query one property(-slot) at a time when they're actually meant
        to be queried together. This could induce consistency issues.

class PropertyNode(object):
    '''
    The SCPI protocol is in many details a hierachical
    one -- commands are being built by extending on a base string
    with sub-branches. For instance:

      - `FUNC <name>` enables a specific function, but
        `FUNC:<name> <param>` sets a specific parameter
         of that function.

      - `BURST:STATE` sets the burst state, `BURST:NCYCLES` sets
        the number of burst cycles, etc.

    This object handles pyVISA communication for one particular SCPI-like
    property. "SCPI-like" here means that the structure is the same as
    with SCPI, but we allow for syntactic differences to be able to cover
    a broader set of pyVISA dialogue (for instance as used in Huber motion
    controllers, which will happily communicate via TCP/IP, USB or GPIB
    via pyVISA, but with a language that differs slightly from SCPI.
    
    For instance, this initializes a property called "burst" on the
    pyVISA device `kdev`:
    ```
       In [1]: bc = PropertyNode(kdev, 'burst:ncycles')
    ```

    Whether it's case sensitive or not ("burst" vs "BURST") is a matter
    of what the device is willing to accept. The underlying Python code
    retains string case.

    Setting and reading properties is done via the functions `.set()` and
    `.get()`, or optionally using the `.__call__()` operator. For instance,
    any of these lines would send the string "off" to be set as
    the number of burst cycles property:
    
    ```
       In [2]: bc("12")

       In [3]: bc.set("12")
    ```

    Reading, conversely:
    
    ```
       In [4]: bc
       Out[4]: "12"

       In [5]: bc.get()
       Out[5]: "12"
    ```

    So far these have been simple examples for simple values. The
    complications arise in two classes:

      - Data conversion: pyVISA is all about strings -- data is read
        and written as strings. Any higher-level data format (integers,
        doubles, booleans etc) need to be done by Python. In addition,
        some commands accept boolean-state strings ("ON" / "OFF"),
        but return integer states (0 / 1). We want those translated
        to and from proper boolean Python data (True / False), for
        instance.

      - Data is not always scalar -- SCPI allows for multiple-parameter
        commands (e.g. "SET:STUFF 1,2,3,4"). He we want multiple things.
        For one, we want to be able to set multiple parameters at once,
        e.g. by using lists or arrays (`.set(1, 2, 3, 4)` or `.set([...])`.
        For another, we want to be able to refer at *one* specific
        parameter out of several (e.g. `PropertyNode(..., 'stuff').set(3)`
        to set and query *only* the 3rd parameter of 'set:stuff').

        On top of all of this, the considerations for data conversion
        (see the first point) also apply.

    This would return the result of the `"BURST:STATE OFF" command.
    Any strings sent are converted to upper case. Any boolean parameters
    (True/False) are converted to "ON" / "OFF".

    In returning values, the class tries first to convert "ON"/"OFF" to
    boolean, than any integer values in might encounter, then floating
    points. If all fail, a regular Python string is returned.

    The specific functions `get()` and `set()` act directly on the root
    command, e.g. this would result in setting the function "FUNC SIN",
    then requesting the function name again (`FUNC?`):
    ```
       p = PropertyBranch(kdev, 'func`)
       p("sin")
       p ## --> 'SIN'
    ```

    The functions `enable()` and `disable()` are shortcuts for `set("ON")`
    and `set("OFF")`, respectively.

        ''' Initializes access to one specific property node.

        Only `dev`, `name`, `nxerror` and `is_root_subclass` are actually
        processed here, all other parameters serve as defaults for the
        getter / setter functions `.get()`, respectively `.set()`, or the
        `__call__` operator.

        Args:
            dev: The VISA resource (device) to use for communication. We
              defer all communication to that device, and pass this on
              to sub-properties, if necessary.
        
            name: The full string for this SCPI property node. Typical
              SCPI properties are key names (as strings). They can be
              hieararchical, in which case the string consists of
              sections delimited by a character, e.g. ":".
              The name here is specified without the trailing separator
              (e.g. `BURST` or `FUNC`, instead of `BURST:` or `FUNC:`).

            nxerror: If this is anything other than `None`,
              the property is read at least once, and `nxerror` is raised
              if the underlying subsystem fails to fetch a value (...typically
              raises `pyvisa.VisaIOError` instead).
              If this is set to `None` (the default), then no check is performed,
              and this class may be erronously initialized, meaning that
              it will raise an error when first used (e.g. on first attempt
              to read or write the property value).

            is_root_subclass: This is mainly intended for subclassing. For
              the default setting (`False`), the class displays behaviour of
              a "normal" node in a tree of properties. This means in particular
              that subnodes (e.g. when invoking `.branch()` or `__getattr__()`)
              will have the same type as this instance.
        
              When this is `True`, the class will instantiate subnodes using
              the type of its superclass instead of its own.

              This behavior can be further tuned / overridden by explicitly
              setting the `._subnode_class` property to a data type to use
              as subnode type.

            getter_fmt: Format for building the getter query. The format
              keyword `name` will be used for the full property
              specification. Will be used by the `.get(...)` function.
              If this is set to `None`, then the property is considered
              write-only and the getter will fail (FIXME: how?)

            setter_fmt: Analogous, format for building the property setter
              query. Keys `{name}` and `{data}` may be used for the
              property name, respectively the data string (!).
              Unnamed formatters (`{}...`) can be used for the argument
              list, corresponding to their data type, as passed to `.set(...)`.
              If this is set to `None`, the property is considered read-only.

           branch_fmt: Indication of how to build sub-branches, given a base
              property name (us) and a subnode (specified). This is used on
              `.__getattr__()`, i.e. when a class attribute is requested
              which doesn't exist, and is then interpreted as a sub-branch.

           unwrap: Defines the unwrapping strategy or procedure. "Unwrapping"
              is the act of transforming device responses packed in arrays
              into individual items.
        
              `unwrap` can either be a callable, or a strategy keyword
              "always", "single", "never", "auto" (the default).

              If `unwrap` is a callable, then it is expected to be a
              single-argument function which takes the response (as string)
              and returns an unwrapped tuple of values (as strings).
              The contents of the `separator` argument (see below) are
              ignored.

              If it's one of the strategy keywords, then the unwrapping
              is an algorithm supplied by default, which is essentially
              variations of a `str.split(separator)` -- depending on the
              strategy setting:

                - "never" doesn't do any kind of array unwrapping, data is
                  returned as-is, as a string. `None` is the same as "never".

                - "single" is similar to "never", except that the value is
                  *required* to always be a single value; if it's an array
                  (i.e. it contains the `separator` substring anywhere), the
                  getter will raise `ValueError.
        
                - with strategy "always", the value received from the device
                  is always assumed to be in array from, and a tuple is
                  returned -- containing a single value (`(val,)`) if there
                  was no array. The array items are strings, stripped by
                  leading and trailing white spaces.
        
                - with "auto", the unwrapper behaves as "single" if there is
                  no separator, or as "always" otherwise. This measn it
                  returns single values directly, and arrays as tuples.

           cast: Determines how a (every) single value is transformed before
              returning. Can be either "auto", "none", a callable, a format
              string, or a tuple containing any of the previous four for every
              of its elements.

              For "none", or `None` no parsing or casting is done -- the
              plain string is retained.

              A callable (e.g. a lambda expression) is expected to take the
              value as its single argument and return a transformed value to
              replace it.

              A format string (`{...}`) is applied to the data and the result
              is returned. Note that this allows to parse the data into
              complex data containers like dictionaries.

              "auto" offers a simple an internal algorithm, whereby the data
              is first interpreted as `int`, then `float`, then returned
              as `str` if all else failed.

              If a tuple is specified, it's required to have the same number
              of elements as the data array, and every tuple element is
              applied to its corresponding array value.

            pack: The opposite of `cast`, determines how every single value
              is to be transformed into a string before sending to the device.
              Possible settings are "auto", "none", a callable, a format string,
              or a tuple which's elements are one of the above. The meaning of
              each setting is mostly  similar to `cast`: a callable is called to
              translate, a format string is used for formatting, and the tuple
              elemetns are used for each value element.

              In a necessary adaptation, "none" or `None` uses the type's
              built-in string casting (`str(...)` -- *some* transformation
              always needs to take place for non-string data), and "auto"
              looks up the corresponding `cast` entry for a format string,
              so that the same format string needs to be specified only once.

            separator: Character or string to use for separating individual
              values of an array. This is used for both incoming and outgoing
              data. Defaults to `","` which turns out to be a sensible setting
              for most SCPI-esque protocols.

        processed as specified by the parameters `unwrap`, `cast` and
        `separator`.

        To understand processing, it's important to consider that all
        responses received from the device are strings. They represent
        either single values, which can be numerical (`int` or `float`),
        boolean (represented as 0 or 1, or as mutually exclusive strings
        like `"ON"` or `"OFF"`), or plain strings. Additionally, they can
        also be lists of parameters as strings (e.g. `"1,jinkies,OFF"`)
        of which each item, in turn, can be interpreted of a specific
        type.

        When the result is a list, then, `.get()` must obviously
        return a tuple of the individual items. But when it's a single
        value, there's a API-philosophical competition between returning
        what requires less boilerplate to work with (i.e. a single value,
        preferrably in its native Python format), or something that's
        more predictable for all cases (i.e.  a tuple with a single item
        in it).
        
        `unpack` and `cast` allow fine-tuning that preference.

        All arguments (`getter_fmt`, `cast`, `unpack` and `separator`)
        are set to defaults here which make them inherit their values
        from was specified in `.__init__()`. Please additionally look
        up their meaning in the documentation for `__init__()` above.
        Overriding the values supplied with `__init__` will have only

              which inherits the value supplied to `.__init__()`, and which,
              in turn, typically defaults to `","`.
        
            unwrap: Dictates whether and how array-like query results
              are to be parsed and interpreted. `None` (the default here)
              inherits from the parameter of the same name passed to

            cast: This is applied to each item individually. The default
              value of anb empty string `""` here inherits from the
              `.__init__()` parameter of the same name.

            getter_fmt: Temporarily overrides the parameter of the same
              name supplied to `__init__`. `fmt` is an alias for this.

            fmt: An alias for `getter_fmt`.
        
        Returns: The result of the `.query()` call, processed as specified
          by the `parse`, `unpack` and `separator` items. This means that
          the bandwidth of possible results is:
        
            - a single plain string, representing an unparsed value
              (e.g. `"3.14"`), or an unparsed list of values
              (e.g. `"3.14,jinkies"`)

            - a single parsed value (e.g. `3.14`)

            - a tuple of unparsed string values (e.g. `("3.14", "jinkies")`)

            - a tuple of parsed values (e.g. `(3.14, "jinkies")`)

            - may raise an exception (`ValueError`) if a single value
              is requeted (e.g. by setting `unpack=False`), but a list
              of values is found, or any other exception which a parser may
              raise if applied to a string it cannot parse.

        Raises: see above.

    Wrapper for VISA based communication with SCPI-enabled devices.
    The API is in many aspects very similar to `easy-scpi`, but differs
    in some implementation details that make this more suitable to work
    with `emmi` subsystems (in particular the EPICS export stuff).

    Usage example, e.g. for setting a function type on a function generator
    (query "FUNC..."), then setting and querying the current frequency
    (query "FREQyency") and voltage offset (query "VOLTage:AMPLitude"):
    ```
      from emmi.scpi import MagicScpi
    
      dev = MagicScpi(dev="TCPIP::10.0.0.61::INSTR")
    
      dev.FUNC("SIN")   ## -> sends "FUNC SIN" to the device
      dev.FREQ("200")   ## -> sends "FREQ 200" to the device
      print ("Current frequency is", dev.FREQ())  ## -> queries "FREQ?" from device

      dev.VOLT.AMPL("3")
      print ("Current voltage amplitude is", dev.VOLT.AMPL())
    ```

    See `escpi` for an example on how to make an EPICS-IOC of a SCPI device.

    This class is actually a more general version, able to speak languages
    that are structurally similar to SCPI, but differ in small parsing
    details (e.g. spacers and separators).

        `MAGICSCPI_ADDRESS` environment variable.

        Args:
            device: The pyVISA device to use.
              This can either be a full pyVISA device (in which case it
              is used as-is, and the `resource_manager` argument is ignored),
              or a string representing a
              [VISA resouce address](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/names.html)
              to connect to.

              As a resource address this could be something along the lines of
              `TCPIP::10.0.0.17::INSTR` for a VISA/SCPI device connected
              via TCP/IP.
              If this parameter is `None`, then a string taken from the
              `MAGICSCPI_ADDRESS` environment variable is used.

            resource_manager: VISA resource manager to use (default is `"@py"`),
              as a string, or as an object. If this is a string, then a resource
              manager object is created using `pyvisa.ResourceManager()`.

            device_conf: A dictionary containing additional configuration keys
              for the VISA resource. If `device` is an address string, then
              `device_conf` defaults to this, which appears to be
              a useful setting for TCP/IP VISA devices:

                  "write_termination": "\n" }
              ```

              If `device` is a pyVISA device object, then `device_conf`

              implicitly altered).
