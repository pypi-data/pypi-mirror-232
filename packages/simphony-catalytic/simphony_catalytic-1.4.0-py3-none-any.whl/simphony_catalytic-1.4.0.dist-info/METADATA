# SimPhoNy-Catalytic

SimPhoNy-Catalytic is a Python package developed by Fraunhofer IWM that provides a convenient interface for running [catalyticFOAM simulations](https://github.com/multiscale-catalysis-polimi/catalyticFoam) using OpenFOAM.

The wrappers of this repository are the driver for running the catalyticFOAM solver, which was developed by Polimi and which is *NOT* included into the code here.

The SimPhoNy-Cataltic interface hosts the code and resources required to set up and run simulations of catalytic reactions in fluid flow systems.

The package is a plugin for [osp-core](https://github.com/simphony/simphony-osp) and hence is a semantic framework based on the [EMMO-ontology](https://github.com/emmo-repo).

## Features

* Simulate laminar or turbulent flow with catalytic reactions.
* Define chemical species and their composition within the mixture.
* Specify boundary conditions for velocity, pressure, and temperature.
* Choose from a range of diffusivity and turbulence models.
* Set up and control simulation parameters such as maximum simulation time, time step length, and more.

## Installation

### Simulation engine

Make sure you have OpenFOAM installed on your system. Refer to the OpenFOAM documentation for installation instructions.

More important, make sure that you have the catalyticFOAM-solver installed on your machine. For the installation procedure, please refer to the [README from polimi](https://github.com/multiscale-catalysis-polimi/catalyticFoam/blob/master/README.md).

### Python dependencies

First of all, you will need to install OSP-core, plams, AdaptiveDesignProcedure and pyZacros (all except osp-core are not on PyPI yet unfortunately):

```shell
(env) user@computer:~/reaxpro-wrappers$ pip install osp-core https://github.com/SCM-NV/pyZacros/archive/refs/tags/v.1.2.zip https://github.com/mbracconi/adaptiveDesignProcedure/archive/refs/tags/v1.4.0.zip git+https://github.com/SCM-NV/PLAMS@7661960a9db53249a0b77935dacc8a7668c2489b
```

Then, install the wrapper. Simply type:

```shell
(env) user@computer:~/reaxpro-wrappers$ pip install simphony-catalytic
```

... or if you are installing from source (cloning of the repository needed before):


```shell
(env) user@computer:~/reaxpro-wrappers$ pip install .
```

## Usage

For detailed examples and usage instructions, refer to the [documentation](https://reaxpro.pages.fraunhofer.de/docs/usecases.html#co-catalyticfoam-use-case-laminar-2d-flow-through-a-pipe-with-catalytic-wall) and example files in the examples directory of this repository.
