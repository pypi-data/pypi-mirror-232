**NOTE**: This package is a work in progress and breaking changes are likely. If you are interested
in using DeepSensor, please get in touch first (tomand@bas.ac.uk).

Why neural processes?
-----------
NPs are a highly flexible class of probabilistic models that can:
- ingest multiple context sets (i.e. data streams) containing gridded or pointwise observations
- handle multiple gridded resolutions
- predict at arbitrary target locations
- quantify prediction uncertainty

These capabilities make NPs well suited to modelling spatio-temporal data, such as
satellite observations, climate model output, and in-situ measurements.
NPs have been used for range of environmental applications, including:
- downscaling (i.e. super-resolution)
- forecasting
- infilling missing satellite data
- sensor placement

Why DeepSensor?
-----------
DeepSensor aims to faithfully match the flexibility of NPs with a simple and intuitive
interface.
DeepSensor wraps around the powerful [neuralprocessess](https://github.com/wesselb/neuralprocesses)
package for the core modelling functionality, while allowing users to stay in
the familiar [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) world
and avoid the murky depths of tensors!

Deep learning library agnosticism
-----------
DeepSensor leverages the [backends](https://github.com/wesselb/lab) package to be compatible with
either [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
Simply `import deepsensor.torch` or `import deepsensor.tensorflow` to choose between them!

Quick start
----------

Here we will demonstrate a simple example of training a convolutional conditional neural process
(ConvCNP) to spatially interpolate ERA5 data.
First, pip install the package. In this case we will use the PyTorch backend.
```bash
pip install deepsensor
pip install torch
```

We can go from imports to predictions with a trained model in less than 30 lines of code!

```python
import deepsensor.torch
from deepsensor.data.processor import DataProcessor
from deepsensor.data.loader import TaskLoader
from deepsensor.model.convnp import ConvNP
from deepsensor.train.train import Trainer

import xarray as xr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load raw data
ds_raw = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")

# Normalise data
data_processor = DataProcessor(x1_name="lat", x2_name="lon")
ds = data_processor(ds_raw)

# Set up task loader
task_loader = TaskLoader(context=ds, target=ds)

# Set up model
model = ConvNP(data_processor, task_loader)

# Generate training tasks with up to 10% of grid cells passed as context and all grid cells
# passed as targets
train_tasks = []
for date in pd.date_range("2013-01-01", "2014-11-30")[::7]:
    task = task_loader(date, context_sampling=np.random.uniform(0.0, 0.1), target_sampling="all")
    train_tasks.append(task)

# Train model
trainer = Trainer(model, lr=5e-5)
for epoch in range(10):
    trainer(train_tasks, progress_bar=True)

# Predict on new task with 10% of context data and a dense grid of target points
test_task = task_loader("2014-12-31", 0.1)
mean_ds, std_ds = model.predict(test_task, X_t=ds_raw)
```

After training, the model can predict directly to `xarray` in your data's original units and coordinate system:
```python
>>> mean_ds
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (time: 1, lat: 25, lon: 53)
Coordinates:
  * time     (time) datetime64[ns] 2014-12-31
  * lat      (lat) float32 75.0 72.5 70.0 67.5 65.0 ... 25.0 22.5 20.0 17.5 15.0
  * lon      (lon) float32 200.0 202.5 205.0 207.5 ... 322.5 325.0 327.5 330.0
Data variables:
    air      (time, lat, lon) float32 246.7 244.4 245.5 ... 290.2 289.8 289.4
```

We can also predict directly to `pandas` containing a timeseries of predictions at off-grid locations
by passing a `numpy` array of target locations to the `X_t` argument of `.predict`:
```python
# Predict at two off-grid locations for three days in December 2014
test_tasks = task_loader(pd.date_range("2014-12-01", "2014-12-31"), 0.1)
mean_df, std_df = model.predict(test_tasks, X_t=np.array([[50, 280], [40, 250]]).T)
```

```python
>>> mean_df
                              air
time       lat  lon              
2014-12-01 50.0 280.0  260.183056
           40.0 250.0  277.947373
2014-12-02 50.0 280.0   261.08943
           40.0 250.0  278.219599
2014-12-03 50.0 280.0  257.128185
           40.0 250.0  278.444229
```

This quickstart example is also available as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor_demos/blob/main/demonstrators/quickstart.ipynb) with added visualisations.

Extending DeepSensor with new models
----------
To extend DeepSensor with a new model, simply create a new class that inherits from `deepsensor.model.DeepSensorModel`
and implement the low-level prediction methods defined in `deepsensor.model.ProbabilisticModel`,
such as `.mean` and `.stddev`.
```python
class NewModel(DeepSensorModel):
    """A very naive model that predicts the mean of the first context set with a fixed stddev"""
    def __init__(self, data_processor: DataProcessor, task_loader: TaskLoader):
        super().__init__(data_processor, task_loader)
        
    def mean(self, task: Task):
        """Compute mean at target locations"""
        return np.mean(task["Y_c"][0])
    
    def stddev(self, task: Task):
        """Compute stddev at target locations"""
        return 0.1
    
    ...
```
`NewModel` can then be used in the same way as the built-in `ConvNP` model.
See [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor_gallery/blob/main/demonstrators/extending_models.ipynb)
for more details.
