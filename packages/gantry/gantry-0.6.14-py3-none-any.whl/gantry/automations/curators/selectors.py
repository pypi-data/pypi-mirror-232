    Stratification mode to use when selecting a subset of data. Currently,
    stratification is only supported for categorical data.

    Selected data will be stratified using one of the modes enumerated here.

    In "strict" mode, the limit of records per curation is respected, but the proportion of records
    in each stratum may be violated, unlike the ProportionalStratificationCurator, which will
    respect the proportion at the (potential) cost of violating the limit per curation.

    Additionally, it is worth noting that the number of records to be added to each stratum
    is calulated exactly, leading to poentially fractional assignments. The integer part
    of the assignment is taken, and the total remainder is added, up to the limit, randomly.

    Example:
        Let's say there are 100 records: 51 records with the value "A" for the field, 15
        records with the value "B" for the field, and 16 records with the value "C" for the
        field, 17 records with the value "D" for the field, and 1 record with the value "E".

        If the limit is 10, then the curator will return 10 records, with 5 records with the
        value "A" for the field, 1 record with "B" for the field, 1 record with "C" for the
        field, 1 record with "D" for the field, 0 records with "E" for the field, and the
        remaining 2 records will be randomly selected from the remaining records.

    In "proportional" mode, the proportion of records in each stratum is respected,
    but the limit per curation may be violated, unlike the StrictStratificationCurator,
    which will respect the limit at the (potential) cost of violating the proportion of
    records in each stratum.

    Additionally, it is worth noting that proportions are rounded to even numbers, so
    1.5 will be rounded to 2, and 0.5 will be rounded to 0.

    Example:
        Let's say there are 100 records: 51 records with the value "A" for the field, 15
        records with the value "B" for the field, and 16 records with the value "C" for the
        field, 17 records with the value "D" for the field, and 1 record with the value "E".

        If the limit is 10, then the curator will return 11 records, with 5 records with the
        value "A" for the field, 2 records with the value "B" for the field, 2 records with
        the value "C" for the field, 2 records with the value "D" for the field, and 0 records
        with the value "E".

    In "balanced" mode, the number of records per stratum is balanced with respect to the
    least represented stratum.
