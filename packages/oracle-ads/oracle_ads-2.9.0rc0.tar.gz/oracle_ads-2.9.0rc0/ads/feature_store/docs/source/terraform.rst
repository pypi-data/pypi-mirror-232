Terraform: Setting up feature store
===================================

Oracle feature store is a stack based solution that is deployed in the customer enclave using OCI resource manager.
Customer can stand up the service with infrastructure in their own tenancy. The service consists of API in customer
tenancy using resource manager.

Below is the terraform stack deployment diagram of the feature store resources.

.. note::

  Blue-green deployment is a strategy for releasing new versions of an application with minimal downtime and risk. It is used in Kubernetes, as well as other deployment environments, to achieve a smooth transition between application versions with the ability to quickly rollback if issues are detected.
  In a blue-green deployment, there are two environments, named "blue" and "green," that run concurrently. One environment is designated as the live or production environment (let's say "blue"), while the other environment ("green") is idle or running a newer version of the application for testing. Both environments have identical configurations and infrastructure.

User policies for stack setup
=============================

Prerequisites (For non admin users only)
#########################################

Feature Store users need to provide the following access permissions in order to deploy the feature store terraform stack. Below mentioned are the policy statements required for terraform stack deployment

..  code-block:: shell

Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager
====================================

.. note::

   If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials. Review and accept the terms and conditions. Refer :ref:`Release Notes` for getting the latest conda pack and ``SERVICE_VERSION``.

.. important::

    Refer :ref:`User Policies` to create feature store stack for non admin users. No policies are explicitly required for admin user.


1. Download the stack from ``Terraform Stack`` column in :ref:`Release Notes`. Refer :ref:`User Policies` to create feature store stack for non admin users. No policies are explicitly required for admin user.

2. Click to deploy the stack

3. Select the region and compartment where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click Terraform Actions, and select Plan.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

7. To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click Edit Stack, and make the required changes. Then, run the Plan action again.

8. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click Terraform Actions, and select Apply.

    User VCN Deployment
    ###################

    User can provide the existing VCN details in order for the feature store to use the existing VCN. Feature store terraform stack provides a terraform vcn variable which takes VCN details as mentioned below:

    .. list-table:: user_vcn
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Variable Name
         - Value
         - Description
       * - `vcn_id`
         - `ocid1.vcn.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - The ocid of the VCN where user wants to deploy feature store.
       * - `vcn_cidr`
         - `10.0.0.0/16`
         - The VCN CIDR range to be used.
       * - `subnet_suffix`
         - `8`
         - The subnet suffix to be used in order to create  service related subnets(for e.g. 10.0.0.0/16 + 8 => 10.0.0.0/24).
       * - `max_subnet`
         - `16`
         - This is an optional variable which tells how many maximum subnet creations are allowed within the CIDR range.
       * - 'dhcp_options_id'
         - 'ocid1.dhcpoptions.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxx'
         - DHCP options ocid is required for instance configuration within the VCN
       * - `igw_id`
         - `ocid1.internetgateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - This is an optional variable which takes internet gateway ocid as an input. Feature store creates the IGW if not provided.
       * - `nat_gw_id`
         - `ocid1.natgateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxx`
         - This is an optional variable which takes nat gateway ocid as an input. Feature store creates the NAT gateway if not provided.
       * - `sgw_id`
         - `ocid1.servicegateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxx`
         - This is an optional variable which takes service gateway ocid as an input. Feature store does not create SGW even when its NULL or does not enable SGW till the time user explicitly using sgw_enable. This is done to ensure that SGW is only enabled for network resources (for e.g. ATP) which allow access through SGW.
       * - `sgw_enable`
         - `false`
         - Enable service gateway usage or creation depending upon the sgw_id provided by the user.
       * - `private_route_table_id`
         - `ocid1.routetable.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - This is an optional variable which takes private route table ocid as an input. If user provides this then it would be user's reponsibilty to ensure that the nat gateway & service gateway(if applicable) route rules have been added for feature store service access. Feature store creates a private route table with supporting route rules if not provided.
       * - `public_route_table_id`
         - `ocid1.routetable.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - This is an optional variable which takes public route table ocid as an input. If user provides this then it would be user's reponsibilty to ensure that the internet gateway route rule has been added for feature store service access. Feature store creates a public route table with supporting route rules if not provided.

    Feature store is deployed in feature store specific subnets and security list access are maintained on the basis of details provided by the user.


    User Input
    ##########

    User will need to provide the following details in order to onboard their own database instances.

    1. DB Config: This is general database configuration which is required for the purpose of initial database setup for BYODB or Feature store's own database setup.

       * - `user_db`
         - `false`
         - set user db to true to enable customer database support (BYODB).

    2. User DB Config: User specific details in order to onboard user database, all of these fields can be kept null if user database is not onboarded

    .. list-table:: user_db_config
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Variable Name
         - Value

    .. tabs::

       .. tab:: MySQL DB Config: MySQL database configuration

          MySQL Instance can only be accessed within the network and for that user will need to deploy the Feature store within their VCN. User will also provide the vault secret for the MySQL database password.
          Please ensure that ingress rules are in place to provide VCN access for the MySQL instance.
          Please refer to this link (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/networking-setup-mysql-db-systems.html) for more details:

              2. Network Access: If ATP instance has network access within VCN only then in cases like these User need to deploy feature store in VCN which has ATP access. User will need to provide the vault secret names which will be used for ATP connection.
