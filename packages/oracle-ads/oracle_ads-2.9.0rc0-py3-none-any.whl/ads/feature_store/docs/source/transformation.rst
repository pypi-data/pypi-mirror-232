Transformation
**************

Transformations in a feature store refers to the operations and processes applied to raw data to create, modify or derive new features that can be used as inputs for ML Models. These transformations are crucial for improving the quality, relevance and usefulness of features which in turn can enhance the performance of ml models. It is an object that represents a transformation applied on the feature group and can be a pandas transformation or spark sql transformation.

Define
======

In an ADS feature store module, you can either use the Python API or YAML to define a transformation.


With the specified way below, you can define a transformation and give it a name.
A ``Transformation`` instance will be created.

.. tabs::

  .. code-tab:: Python3
    :caption: Python

    from ads.feature_store.transformation import Transformation

    transformation = (
        Transformation
        .with_name("<transformation_name>")
        .with_feature_store_id("<feature_store_id>")
        .with_source_code("<source_code>")
        .with_transformation_mode("<transformation_mode>")
        .with_description("<transformation_description>")
        .with_compartment_id("<compartment_id>")
    )

  .. code-tab:: Python3
    :caption: YAML

    from ads.feature_store.transformation import Transformation

    yaml_string = """
    kind: transformation
    spec:
      compartmentId: ocid1.compartment..<unique_id>
      description: <transformation_description>
      name: <transformation_name>
      featureStoreId: <feature_store_id>
      sourceCode: <source_code>
      transformationMode: <transformation_mode>
    type: transformation
    """

    transformation = Transformation.from_yaml(yaml_string)


Create
======

You can call the ``create()`` method of the ``Transformation`` instance to create an transformation.

.. code-block:: python3

  # Create an transformation
  transformation.create()


Load
====

Use the ``from_id()`` method from the ``Transformation`` class to load an existing transformation with its OCID provided. It returns a ``Transformation`` instance.

.. code-block:: python3

  from ads.feature_store.transformation import Transformation

  transformation = Transformation.from_id("ocid1.transformation..<unique_id>")

Delete
======

Use the ``.delete()`` method on the ``Transformation`` instance to delete a transformation.

A transformation can only be deleted when its associated entities are all deleted,

.. code-block:: python3

  transformation.delete()
