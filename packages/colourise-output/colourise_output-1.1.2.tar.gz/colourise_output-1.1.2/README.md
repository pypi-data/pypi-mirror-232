## Installation

### Using pip

```sh
pip install -U colorama
pip install -U colourise-output
```

### Using python

Under windows:

```bat
py -m pip install -U colorama
py -m pip install -U colourise-output
```

Under Linux/Mac OS:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -U colorama
python3 -m pip install -U colourise-output
```

## Usage

### Importing

```py
import colourise_output as co
```

### Initialising

The generic class is: `ColouriseOutput()`
The generic loading function is: `init_ressources(self)`
The output is: None

```py
COI = co.ColouriseOutput()
COI.init_ressources()
```

### Calling the test_colours function

The generic function is:

```py
test_colours(self, delay:int=0)
```

The output is: None

```py
COI.test_colours()
```

Calling this function will result in the function displaying all the available colours as well as their colour code (what you use to call them).

#### Epilepsy warning

Warning: Avoid this function if you are epileptic or set the delay to 1

```py
COI.test_colours(1)
```

### Changing the colour

The generic function to ask a question is:

```py
display(self, colour:str, attributes:tuple=(), text:str="")
```

The outputs of this function is: None
The terminal will display the next lines in the desired colour.

#### Displaying text and the colour

```py
COI.display("0A", (), "Hello World !\n")
```

The text "Hello World" will be displayed in green (A) on a black background (0).

#### Only changing the colour

```py
answer = AQI.ask_question("How old are you?", "uint")
ADD_S = ""
if answer > 1:
    ADD_S = "s"
print(f"You are {answer} year{ADD_S} old !")
```

## Available colours

Here is the windows colour pallet and how to use it:

### Windows colour pallet

* 0: Black
* 1: Blue
* 2: Green
* 3: Aqua
* 4: Red
* 5: Purple
* 6: Yellow
* 7: White
* 8: Gray
* 9: Light Blue
* A: Light Green
* B: Light Aqua
* C: Light Red
* D: Light Purple
* E: Light Yellow
* F: Bright White

### Using the Windows colour pallet

## Change the initialisation content

When initialising the class it is possible to change the forbidden characters and/or the descriptions of the available types.

### changing the forbidden characters

```py
import ask_question as aq
illegal_characters = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c"
illegal_characters = illegal_characters.replace("0123456789","")
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(dict(), illegal_characters)
```

This initialisation has changed the characters that will be allowed for the number conversion in the 'int' and 'float' options.

### Changing the descriptions

```py
import ask_question as aq
human_type = {
    "int":"whole number (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)",
    "float":"floating number (-1.2, 0.1, 1.2, etc...)",
    "uint":"whole positive number (0, 1, 2, etc...)",
    "ufloat":"whole positive floating number (0.1, 1.2, etc ...)",
    "num":"numeric (numbers from 0 onwards)",
    "alnum":"alphanumeric (only numbers and the alphabet)",
    "isalpha":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "char":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "ascii":"ascii Table",
    "str":"string (any character you can type)",
    "version":"version (numbers seperated by '.' characters)",
    "ver":"version (numbers seperated by '.' characters)",
    "bool":"boolean (yes/True/1 or no/False/0 answer type)",
}
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(human_type)
```

This initialisation has changed the descriptions for the types.
When the user will enter a wrong answer, the description displayed for the type you were expecting will be taken from the human_type dictionnary you have entered.

### Changing both

```py
import ask_question as aq
illegal_characters = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!\"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c"
illegal_characters = illegal_characters.replace("0123456789","")
human_type = {
    "int":"whole number (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)",
    "float":"floating number (-1.2, 0.1, 1.2, etc...)",
    "uint":"whole positive number (0, 1, 2, etc...)",
    "ufloat":"whole positive floating number (0.1, 1.2, etc ...)",
    "num":"numeric (numbers from 0 onwards)",
    "alnum":"alphanumeric (only numbers and the alphabet)",
    "isalpha":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "char":"alphabet (from a to z and A to Z)",
    "ascii":"ascii Table",
    "str":"string (any character you can type)",
    "version":"version (numbers seperated by '.' characters)",
    "ver":"version (numbers seperated by '.' characters)",
    "bool":"boolean (yes/True/1 or no/False/0 answer type)",
}
AQI = aq.AskQuestion(human_type)
```

You have now impacted the int and float typing as well as the 'type' descriptions.

## Author

This module was written by (c) Henry Letellier
Attributions are appreciated.

Quick way (I assume you have already initialised the class):

```py
print(f"AskQuestion is written by {AQI.author}")
```

## Version

The current version is 1.0.0

An easy way to display the version is:

```py
import ask_question as aq
print(f"Version : {aq.__Version__}")
```
