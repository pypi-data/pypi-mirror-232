        ## researchpal: A Python Library for Automated Literature Review Generation
        
        ## What is it?
        researchpal is a Python library that automates the process of generating academic literature reviews based on a research question. It utilizes external data sources to fetch research papers, synthesizes the findings, and generates a concise literature review. This library is particularly useful for researchers and students looking to streamline the literature review process.
        
        ## Features:
        * Fetches research papers from Springer and Arxiv.
        * Synthesizes research findings into a coherent literature review.
        * Extracts citations and generates a references list.
        * Supports both short(cite around 5 research papers) and long(cite around 10 research papers) literature reviews.
        
        ## Prerequisites:
        Before using researchpal, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
        
        * Python 3.8 installed on your system.
        * An API key for OpenAI (required for certain functionalities).
        
        ## Installation:
        To install researchpal, you can use pip: 
        
        > pip install researchpal
        
        ## Usage:
        Here's a basic example of how to use researchpal in your Python script:
        
        > from researchpal import generate_literature_review\
        \
        > research_question = *"your_query"* \
        > openai_key = *"your_openai_api_key"* \
        > length (by default) = *"short"*  # can be "short" or "long"\
        \
        > literature_review.generate_literature_review(research_question, openai_key, length)
        
        ## Options:
        * research_question: Your research question.
        * openai_key: Your OpenAI API key.
        * length: The length of the literature review ("short" or "long," default is "short").
