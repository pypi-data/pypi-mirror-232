class HandlerManager:
    """
    A manager class for handling various functionalities and operations using
    handler classes.

    This class provides access to different handlers such as LogHandler,
    CleanUpHandler, SeleniumHandler, DirectoryHandler, and SettingsHandler.

    Attributes:
        etl (Callable): A callable reference to the ETLHandler class, which can
            be used to run ETL processes for CSV, JSON, and Pandas DataFrame
            data when needed.
        settings (SettingsHandler): An instance of the SettingsHandler class,
            which can be used to access and modify settings.
        logs (Callable[str]): A callable reference to the LogHandler class,
            which can be used to manage logs. You can provide a name for the
            log instance.
        cli (Callable[List[str]]): A callable reference to the CLIHandler
            class, which can be used to run scripts from the command line
            interface.
        db (Callable[str]): A callable reference to the DatabaseHandler class,
            which can be used to run CRUD processes for databases. You can
            provide a database connection string.
        cleanup (Callable): A callable reference to the CleanUpHandler class,
            which can be used to manage cleanup tasks.
        scripts (Callable): A callable reference to the ScriptsHandler class,
            which can be used to manage and run Python scripts.
        selenium (Callable): A callable reference to the SeleniumHandler class,
            which can be used to interact with Selenium.
        directories (Callable): A callable reference to the DirectoryHandler
            class, which can be used to manage directories.

    Example:
        # Access the LogHandler
        logs = HandlerManager.logs("MyLogger")

        # Access the SettingsHandler
        settings = HandlerManager.settings
        max_retries = settings.get_setting("max_retries")

    Note:
        This class assumes that the referenced handler classes
        (LogHandler, CleanUpHandler, etc.) have been properly imported and
        exist in the current module or package.
