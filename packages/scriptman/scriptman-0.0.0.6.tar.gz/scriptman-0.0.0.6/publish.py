    A utility class for automating the package publishing process.

    Args:
        package_name (str): The name of the Python package.
        version (str): The new version to set for the package.

    Attributes:
        dir (str): The root directory of the Script Manager application.

        publishing process.

    Example:
        >>> helper = PackagePublishHelper("my_package", "1.0.2")
