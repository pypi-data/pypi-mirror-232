    The core method of this library - returns all the useful information extracted from the HTML of the next
    article at the supplied URL.

    :param str url: A valid URL to some news article online that we want to extract info from
    :param str html_text: (optional) Supply the HTML text you already fetched from that URL. If None, we will download
                          the HTML for you, with some reasonable timeout defaults.
    :param bool include_other_metadata: Pass in true to top_image, authors, and other things returned under an `other`
                                        property in the results. Warning - this can slow down extraction by around 5x.
