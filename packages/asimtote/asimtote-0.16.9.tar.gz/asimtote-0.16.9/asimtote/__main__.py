# This dictionary specifies the available platforms available to compare

# name and specifies two values in a tuple, giving the object classes to be

# difference comparator.

    """This function compares the old and new configurations for the
    specified device and writes a difference configuration file (one
    that transforms the configuration of a running device from the old
    to the new state).

    The filenames for the configuration files, as well as the output
    are taken from the arguments parsed above and stored in global
    variables used directly by this function.

    The function returns True iff the parsing and comparison succeeded.
    Most problems result in the function aborting with an exception,
    but some minor warnings may be ignored and the program continue
    with devices.

    Keyword arguments:

    diff -- the DiffConfig object to do the convert the configuration

    devicename -- the name of the device being converted, or None if
    it's not known

    old_filename -- filename of the source configuration

    new_filename -- filename of the target configuration

    output_filename -- name of the file to write the conversion
    configuration to or None for standard output

    no_output -- a boolean set to True iff no output file is to be
    written

    variables to command line arguments
