    form so two lists can be compared.  The list is supplied and
    returned as a new list of IOS rules.  Note that it is not sorted in
    place), as parsed by _ip_acl_std_rule_parse().

    IPv4 standard ACLs are complicated in IOS due to its tendancy to
    reorganise the rules, after they're entered.  It always preserves
    the semantics of the list (never putting an overlapping 'permit' and
    'deny' in the wrong order), but it can move rules which don't
    interact around.  Presumably this is done to optimise processing.

    The solution adopted here is to build the ACLs up in blocks.  Each
    block is a set of rules where the address portions don't overlap;
    these are built, sorting each block into address order, before
    adding the sorted rules in the block into the resulting list.

    Note that this can result in 'permit' and 'deny' entries swapping
    order, as long as the addresses don't overlap.  For example, 'permit
    host 20.0.0.1', 'deny host 10.0.0.1' would be reversed into 'deny
    host 10.0.0.1', 'permit host 20.0.0.1' as the rules are organised
    into addresses order ('10.0.0.1' < '20.0.0.1').

    The result is lists which are not necessarily in the same order as
    they were constructed, nor how IOS stores them, but two lists should
    at least be in the same order so they can be directly compared.

    This function is applied to each list, after the configuration is
    read, and the returned list used to replace the order in which the
    rules were read.
