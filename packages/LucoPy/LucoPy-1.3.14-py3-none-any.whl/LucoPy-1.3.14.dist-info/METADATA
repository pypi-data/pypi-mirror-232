# LucoPy

Python SDK to interact with the Luco API.

Contact: support@lu.co

---

## How to Use

Install the latest version from PyPI using PIP

```bash
pip install LucoPy
```

Or, specify a version

```bash
pip install LucoPy==x.x.x
```

Import the LucoApi class from the LucoPy library in your script and create an object of this class by passing in the API base url and the appropriate credentials. E.g.

```bash
from LucoPy import LucoApi

api = LucoApi(base_url, tenant_id, client_id, client_secret, resource_id)
```

---

## Authentication

In order to make calls to the API endpoints, LucoPy must be able to generate an authenticated access token. Authentication is managed by the ApiCore class using an identity provided during the instantiation of the LucoApi object.

### Azure Service Principal

If the Luco instance is hosted on Azure, a service principal can be used to authenticate to the API. In order to use a service principal, an App Registration must be created in the same Azure subscription as the Luco instance. The required credentials must then be passed as arguments to the LucoApi class when instantiating it. These credentials are:

- `tenant_id` - Directory (tenant) ID of the App Registration representing LucoPy
- `client_id` - Application (client) ID of the App Registration representing LucoPy
- `client_secret` - Secret value of the App Registration representing LucoPy
- `resource_id` - Application (client) ID of the target App Registration representing the API

If these values are not passed as direct arguments to the LucoApi class, the object will look for the following environment variables:

- LUCO_TENANT_ID
- LUCO_CLIENT_ID
- LUCO_CLIENT_SECRET
- LUCO_RESOURCE_ID

### Other Identities

Any custom identity object can be passed into the LucoApi class via the `identity` kwarg when instantiating the LucoApi class. This idenity object must have a method called `generate_token()` which returns an access token validated to the API and the expiry datetime of this token.

---

### LucoApi Class

`LucoApi(base_url=None, tenant_id=None, client_id=None, client_secret=None, resource_id=None, identity=None, timeout=20, log=False)`

This class acts as the gateway to the Luco platform. An instance of this class should be created at the beginning of each script, API calls are then made through the ApiCore which handles the necessary authentication.

The base URL of the API instance must be passed as a parameter to this object, or as an environment variable called LUCO_BASE_URL, along with the method of authentication.

The `timeout` option defines the maximum time (seconds) to wait for an HTTPS response from the API before causing a failure.

Use the `log` argument to turn logging on or off. Logs are generated and sent to a log.txt file in the base directory alongside where the script is being run.

1) `find_slot_id(tag, slot_sequence)`

## Data Quality

This data quality module provides functionality to support the handling of data quality results. This module will support the conversion of DQ results from a variety of tools into a consistent format which can be submitted to Luco. This generic format is based around the concepts of **checks** and **collections**.

A **collection** is a dictionary object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "name": "string",
    "tool": "string",
    "toolVersion": "1.2.3",
    "referenceUrl": "<some-url>",
    "checks": [
        {
            "check": "expect $col1 to not be null", // Required
            "checkArgs": {
                "col1": "Id"
            },
            "success": true, // Required
            "onFail": {
                "ignore": true,
                "failedRecordsLink": "<link-to-blob-storage>"
            },
            "observed": {
                "elementCount": 10,
                "failedPercentage": "10.0%"
            },
            "referenceUrl": "<some-url>",
            "tags": [
                "Completeness"
            ],
            "metadata": {}
        }
    ],
    "start": "2022-10-04 10:00:00",
    "end": "2022-10-04 10:10:00",
    "metadata": {}
}
```

Using the `Submission.submit_quality()` method, DQ results can be submitted as either a single **check** or as a **collection** of checks.

### Fail conditions

Checks and Collections can have both a `success` and an `action` associated with them. `success` describes the result of the check i.e. did any records fail the check? Or, was the failure rate within an acceptable threshold? Every check must have a `success` value associated with it. 

`action` is an optional piece of metadata associated with a DQ check or collection. It describes what happens to the ongoing data process as a result of the success or failure of the data qualtity checks. For example, if the data fails some key checks then the `action` may be to cancel the data delivery process rather than continue with bad data.

The `onFail` field can be used to define what the `action` should be as a result of the `success` of DQ checks. This is a flexible field and custom logic can used to determine the `action` based on this field. 

The default behaviour is to ignore failed checks and continue the data delivery unless configured otherwise. If there should be a dependency on a check then this can be defined with:

```JSON
"onFail": {
    "action": "fail"
}
```

The `CheckResult` and `CollectionResult` objects have methods `is_exception_thrown()` which return True if there is a check which has `"success": False` and `"action": "fail"`. This is the method that is used if the kwarg `auto_determine_action` is `True` when `Submission.submit_quality()` is called.

### Great Expectations

The `great_expectations` submodule supports the handling of validation results from running expectations and suites against a dataframe.

Utility functions are provided to convert the validations results into a shape supported by Luco:

```python
import LucoPy.data_quality.great_expectations.utils as ge_utils

check = ge_utils.convert_expectation_to_check(expectation)

collection = ge_utils.convert_suite_to_collection(suite)
```

Where `expectation` and `suite` are the validation results as dict objects.

1) `convert_expectation_to_check(expectation_results, metadata_mappings={})`

    Convert an expectation validation result dict into a `CheckResult` object.

    Args:
    - expectation_results (dict) : Validation result dict
    - metadata_mappings (dict) : Custom mappings of key:value pairs in the `meta` field.

    Returns:
    - CheckResult

2) `convert_suite_to_collection(expectation_suite_results: dict, suite_mappings={}, expectation_mappings={})`

    Convert a suite validation result dict into a `CollectionResult` object.

    Args:
    - expectation_suite_results (dict) : Validation result dict
    - suite_mappings (dict) : Custom mappings of key:value pairs in the suite level `meta` field.
    - expectation_mappings (dict) : Custom mappings of key:value pairs in the expectation level `meta` fields.

    Returns:
    - CollectionResult

Data stored in the `meta` fields of the validation result objects can be mapped and then surfaced in the Luco UI. There are a number of *recognised fields* which Luco will detect and display differently to other metadata. The currently supported fields and their default custom mappings are:

Expectation Meta

| Recognised Field | Default Expected Name | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| onFail    | onFail    | Behaviour for when an expectation fails |
| referenceUrl   | referenceUrl    | URL linking to the expectation definition |
| tags   | tags    | Tags linked to the Data Quality Categories defined in Luco |

Expectation Suite Meta

| Recognised Field | Default Expected Name | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| toolVersion    | great_expectations_version    | Version of GE used |
| name    | expectation_suite_name    | Name of the expectation suite |
| start    | validation_time    | Datetime of when the validation was performed |
| referenceUrl   | referenceUrl    | URL linking to the expectation suite definition |
| tags   | tags    | Tags linked to the Data Quality Categories defined in Luco |

In order to implement custom mappings for these recognised fields, a dictionary of the custom mappings should be provided. E.g.

```python

# Keys should be the recognised fields
# Values should be the fields present in meta
expectation_mapping = {
    "onFail": "Action",
    "referenceUrl": "reference_url"
}

check = convert_expectation_to_check(expectation_result,
                                     metadata_mappings=expectation_mapping)
```
