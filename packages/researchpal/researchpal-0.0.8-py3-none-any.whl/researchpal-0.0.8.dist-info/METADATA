## researchpal: A Python Library for Automated Literature Review Generation

## What is it?
researchpal is a Python library that automates the process of generating academic literature reviews based on a research question. It utilizes external data sources to fetch research papers, synthesizes the findings, and generates a concise literature review. This library is particularly useful for researchers and students looking to streamline the literature review process.

## Features:
* Fetches research papers from Springer and Arxiv.
* Synthesizes research findings into a coherent literature review.
* Extracts citations and generates a references list.
* Supports both short and long literature reviews.

## Prerequisites:
Before using researchpal, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* Python 3.8 installed on your system.
* An API key for OpenAI (required for certain functionalities).

## Installation:
To install researchpal, you can use pip: 

> pip install researchpal

## Usage:
Here's a basic example of how to use researchpal in your Python script: from researchpal import literature_review

> from researchpal import generate_literature_review\
\
> research_question = *"your_query"* \
> openai_key = *"your_openai_api_key"* \
> length (by default) = *"short"*  # can be "short" or "long"\
\
> literature_review.generate_literature_review(research_question, openai_key, length)

generate_literature_review(research_question, openai_key, length)

## Options:
* research_question: Your research question.
* openai_key: Your OpenAI API key.
* length: The length of the literature review ("short" or "long," default is "short").
