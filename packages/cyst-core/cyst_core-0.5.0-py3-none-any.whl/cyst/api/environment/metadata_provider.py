    Metadata providers supply messages with additional information that are meant to mimic observations that can be
    done in the real life. Two typical examples of metadata can be 1) flow information, 2) results of traffic analyses.

        """
        There can be classes of metadata that are different for a particular action with particular parameters as
        defined by the behavioral model. These different classes can manifest depending on parameters that are not
        considered in the model itself. An example of such difference are various scanning techniques for a
        reconnaissance action (e.g., SYN, FIN, XMAS scans). Each of these techniques would have different statistical
        properties that would reflect in, e.g., flow information.

        This function gives the metadata providers an option to inject its own parameters into the actions of the action
        store. These parameters should have a closed parameter domain for this to be reasonably usable.
        Considering that this inject is done on a per-action basis, the metadata provider must understand the
        semantic of specific actions, so it is expected that such providers are released together with behavioral
        model implementation.
