Write a streamlit file uploader code and return the path of uploaded file as a string depending on the instruction given to you:
Since st.file_uploader.name does not give full file path, you first need to save it then get a full file path like in the following:

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload Txt File", type=["txt"], key='{variable}')
if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Create a temporary file to store the uploaded content
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(uploaded_file.read())
        {variable} = temp_file.name # it shows the file path
else:
    {variable} = ''

Suppose that, streamlit has been imported by "import streamlit as st" so you don't need to import it.
Assign the file path to the variable called "{variable}"
You will basically use file_uploader and get file path from it but nothing else.
Do not loose the file path and check if the file is uploaded. Otherwise, assign empty string to "{variable}"
Don't read the file, only get the file path
In the st.file_uploader, change type parameter compatible with the type of the expected file such as pdf, csv, ...
