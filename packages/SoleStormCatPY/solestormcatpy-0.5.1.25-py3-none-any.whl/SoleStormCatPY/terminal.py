"""This brings the user's terminal into your Python script. Run any command you want. In this example, the user will enter their command:

import SoleStormCatPY.terminal as cmd

command = input('''What command do you want the system to run?
''')

cmd.terminalrun(command)

This example runs your custom commands:

import SoleStormCatPY.terminal as cmd

command = 'pip list'
cmd.terminalrun(command)

This Example Uses GUI, letting Users use their own commands, even if they want to use GUI!:
import SoleStormCatPY.terminal as cmd

cmd.terminalGUI()

You can also use the terminal to update SoleStormCatPY by entering "UpgradePyApp" as the command!
