# Graphics Maker (Python)

# What

This is a simple python package that provides a way to generate flat design animation videos.
It allows for simple shapes and transitions of location, rotation and scale.

# Why

I was tired of building animations with other tools and getting choppy/unsatisfactory results. I'm also too cheap and lazy to pay for an expensive tool, and then have to learn all the intricacies. So I just made this for myself.

# Examples

Example programs using the lib are in `examples/`. Feel free to run it locally and generate the videos!
