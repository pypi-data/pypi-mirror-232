        """Create a new virtual or physical card.

        Parameters `pin`, `shippingAddress`, and
        `product_id` only apply to physical cards.

        Args:
          type:
              Card types:

              - `MERCHANT_LOCKED` - Card is locked to first merchant that successfully
                authorizes the card.
              - `PHYSICAL` - Manufactured and sent to the cardholder. We offer white label
                branding, credit, ATM, PIN debit, chip/EMV, NFC and magstripe functionality.
                Reach out at [lithic.com/contact](https://lithic.com/contact) for more
                information.
              - `SINGLE_USE` - Card will close shortly after the first transaction.
              - `VIRTUAL` - Card will authorize at any merchant and can be added to a digital
                wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay (if the card program is digital
                wallet-enabled).

          account_token: Only required for multi-account users. Token identifying the account the card
              will be associated with. Only applicable if using account holder enrollment. See

              more information.

          card_program_token: Identifies the card program under which to create the card. Different card
              programs may have their own configurations (e.g., digital wallet card art, BIN
              type). This must be configured with Lithic before use.

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          funding_token: The token for the desired `FundingAccount` to use when making transactions with
              this card.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card.

          not: Used to test the PythonSDKs ability to handle reserved keywords as parameters

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Specifies the configuration (e.g., physical card art) that the card should be
              manufactured with, and only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` [beta]. This
              must be configured with Lithic before use.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL [beta]. Use
              of options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorizate multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.

          card_program_token: Identifies the card program under which to create the card. Different card
              programs may have their own configurations (e.g., digital wallet card art, BIN
              type). This must be configured with Lithic before use.

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          funding_token: The token for the desired `FundingAccount` to use when making transactions with
              this card.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card.

          not: Used to test the PythonSDKs ability to handle reserved keywords as parameters

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Specifies the configuration (e.g., physical card art) that the card should be
              manufactured with, and only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` [beta]. This
              must be configured with Lithic before use.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL [beta]. Use
              of options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorizate multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.

        Args:
          type:
              Card types:

              - `MERCHANT_LOCKED` - Card is locked to first merchant that successfully
                authorizes the card.
              - `PHYSICAL` - Manufactured and sent to the cardholder. We offer white label
                branding, credit, ATM, PIN debit, chip/EMV, NFC and magstripe functionality.
                Reach out at [lithic.com/contact](https://lithic.com/contact) for more
                information.
              - `SINGLE_USE` - Card will close shortly after the first transaction.
              - `VIRTUAL` - Card will authorize at any merchant and can be added to a digital
                wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay (if the card program is digital
                wallet-enabled).

          account_token: Only required for multi-account users. Token identifying the account the card
              will be associated with. Only applicable if using account holder enrollment. See

              more information.

          card_program_token: Identifies the card program under which to create the card. Different card
              programs may have their own configurations (e.g., digital wallet card art, BIN
              type). This must be configured with Lithic before use.

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          funding_token: The token for the desired `FundingAccount` to use when making transactions with
              this card.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card.

          not: Used to test the PythonSDKs ability to handle reserved keywords as parameters

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Specifies the configuration (e.g., physical card art) that the card should be
              manufactured with, and only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` [beta]. This
              must be configured with Lithic before use.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL [beta]. Use
              of options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorizate multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later

              - `PHYSICAL` - Manufactured and sent to the cardholder. We offer white label
                branding, credit, ATM, PIN debit, chip/EMV, NFC and magstripe functionality.
                Reach out at [lithic.com/contact](https://lithic.com/contact) for more
                information.
              - `SINGLE_USE` - Card will close shortly after the first transaction.
              - `VIRTUAL` - Card will authorize at any merchant and can be added to a digital
                wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay (if the card program is digital
                wallet-enabled).

          account_token: Only required for multi-account users. Token identifying the account the card
              will be associated with. Only applicable if using account holder enrollment. See
              [Managing Your Program](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/managing-your-program) for
              more information.

          card_program_token: Identifies the card program under which to create the card. Different card
              programs may have their own configurations (e.g., digital wallet card art, BIN
              type). This must be configured with Lithic before use.

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          funding_token: The token for the desired `FundingAccount` to use when making transactions with
              this card.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card.

          not: Used to test the PythonSDKs ability to handle reserved keywords as parameters

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Specifies the configuration (e.g., physical card art) that the card should be
              manufactured with, and only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` [beta]. This
              must be configured with Lithic before use.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL [beta]. Use
              of options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorizate multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.
