Give Mycroft some sass with [DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT)

While this can not compete with [ChatGPT Persona](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-solver-plugin-openai-persona) it is an offline alternative, you can use any model from huggingface to have different personas

Find models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=conversational&search=dialogpt)

## Examples 
* "What is best in life?"
