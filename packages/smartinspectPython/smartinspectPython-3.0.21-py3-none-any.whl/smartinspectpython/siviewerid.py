    Specifies the viewer for displaying the title or data of a Log
    Entry in the Console.

    There are many viewers available for displaying the data of a
    Log Entry in different ways. For example, there are viewers that
    can display lists, tables, binary dumps of data or even websites.

    Every viewer in the Console has a corresponding so called viewer
    context in this library which can be used to send custom logging
    information. To get started, please see the documentation of the
    SISession.LogCustomContext method and SIViewerContext class.
