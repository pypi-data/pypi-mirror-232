    """
    Represents the Watch packet type which is used in the Watch
    methods in the SISession class.

    A Watch is responsible for sending variables and their values
    to the Console. These key/value pairs will be displayed in the
    Watches toolbox. If a Watch with the same name is sent twice,
    the old value is overwritten and the Watches toolbox displays
    the most current value.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. However, instances
        of this class will normally only be used in the context of a
        single thread.
