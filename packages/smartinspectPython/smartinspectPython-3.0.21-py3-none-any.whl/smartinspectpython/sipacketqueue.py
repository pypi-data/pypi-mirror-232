    Manages a memory size limited queue of packets.

    This class is responsible for managing a size limited queue
    of packets. This functionality is needed by the protocol
    SIProtocol.IsValidOption feature. The maximum
    total memory size of the queue can be set with the Backlog
    property. New packets can be added with the Push method. Packets
    which are no longer needed can be retrieved and removed from the
    queue with the Pop method.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
