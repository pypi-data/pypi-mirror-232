    Is the abstract base class for a viewer context. A viewer context
    is the library-side representation of a viewer in the Console.

    A viewer context contains a viewer ID and data which can be
    displayed in a viewer in the Console. Every viewer in the Console
    has a corresponding viewer context class in this library. A viewer
    context is capable of processing data and to format it in a way
    so that the corresponding viewer in the Console can display it.

    Viewer contexts provide a simple way to extend the functionality
    of the SmartInspect library. See the SISession.LogCustomContext
    method for a detailed example.
