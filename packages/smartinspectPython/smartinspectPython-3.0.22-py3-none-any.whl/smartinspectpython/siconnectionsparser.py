    Responsible for parsing a SmartInspect connections string.

    This class offers a single method only, called Parse, which is
    responsible for parsing a connections string. This method informs
    the caller about found protocols and connections by raising the
    ConnectionFoundEvent event.

        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.

                The options of the new protocol.

        This method parses the supplied connections part of a connections
