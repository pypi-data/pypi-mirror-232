    """
    Represents the Process Flow packet type which is used in the
    EnterMethod and LeaveMethod methods in the SISession class.

    A Process Flow entry is responsible for illustrated process and
    thread information. 
    
    It has several properties which describe its creation context
    (like a thread ID, time-stamp or hostname) and other properties
    which specify the way the Console interprets this packet (like the
    process flow ID). Furthermore a Process Flow entry contains the
    actual data, namely the title, which will be displayed in the
    Console.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. However, instances
        of this class will normally only be used in the context of a
        single thread.
