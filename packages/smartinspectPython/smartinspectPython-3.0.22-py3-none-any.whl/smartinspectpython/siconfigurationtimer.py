class SIConfigurationTimer:
    """
    Monitors a SmartInspect configuration settings file for changes
    and reloads the configuration when it does.

    Use this class to monitor and automatically reload SmartInspect
    configuration files.  This class periodically checks if the
    related configuration file has changed (by comparing the last
    modified datetime) and automatically tries to reload the configuration
    properties. You can pass the SmartInspect object to configure,
    the path of the configuration file to monitor, and the interval
    in which the path should check for changes.

    For information about SmartInspect configuration files, please
    refer to the documentation of the SmartInspect.LoadConfiguration
    method.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is fully thread-safe.
