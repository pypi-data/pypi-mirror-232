    """
    Used for sending packets to a local SmartInspect Console over a
    named pipe connection.  This protocol only works on Windows-based
    systems, as it utilizes a Win32 API for named pipe access.
    
    This class is used for sending packets through a local named pipe
    to the SmartInspect Console. It is used when the 'pipe' protocol
    is specified in the SmartInspect.Connections.  Please see the 
    IsValidOption method for a list of available protocol options. 
    Please note that this protocol can only be used for local connections. 
    For remote connections to other machines, please use SITcpProtocol.

    For a list of available protocol options, please refer to the
    IsValidOption method.
