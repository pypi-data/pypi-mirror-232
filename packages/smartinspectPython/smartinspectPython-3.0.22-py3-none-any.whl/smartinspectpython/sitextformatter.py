    Responsible for creating a text representation of a packet and
    writing it to a stream.

    This class creates a text representation of a packet and writes
    it to a stream. The representation can be influenced with the
    Pattern property. The Compile method preprocesses a packet and
    computes the required size of the packet. The Write method writes
    the preprocessed packet to the supplied stream.

        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
