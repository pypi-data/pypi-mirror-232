    Used internally to report any kind of error.

    This is the base class for several exceptions which are mainly
    used for internal error reporting. However, it can be useful
    to have a look at its derived classes, SILoadConnectionsException
    and SIProtocolException, which provide additional information
    about occurred errors besides the normal exception message.

    This can be useful if you need to obtain more information about
    a particular error in the SmartInspect.Error event.
