    Represents the list viewer in the Console which can display simple lists of text data.

    The list viewer in the Console interprets the Log Entry Data as a list. 
    Every line in the text data is interpreted as one item of the list. 
    This class takes care of the necessary formatting and escaping required 
    by the corresponding list viewer in the Console.

    You can use the SIListViewerContext class for creating custom
    log methods around SISession.LogCustomContext
    for sending custom data organized as simple lists.

        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
