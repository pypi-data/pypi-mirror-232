    Represents the Log Header packet type which is used for storing
    and transferring log metadata.
    
    The SILogHeader class is used to store and transfer log metadata.
    After the SIPipeProtocol or SITcpProtocol has established a connection,
    a Log Header packet with the metadata of the current logging
    context is created and written. Log Header packets are used by
    the SmartInspect Router application for its filter and trigger
    functionality.

        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. However, instances
        of this class will normally only be used in the context of a single thread.
