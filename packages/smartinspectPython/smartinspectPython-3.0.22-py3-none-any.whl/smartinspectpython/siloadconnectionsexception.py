class SILoadConnectionsException(Exception):
    """
    Used to report errors concerning the SmartInspect.LoadConnections method.

    This exception is used to report errors concerning the
    SmartInspect.LoadConnections method. This method is able to load
    a SmartInspect.Connections from a file.
    Therefore errors can occur when trying to load a connections string
    from an inexistent file or when the file can not be opened for
    reading, for example.

    If such an error occurs, an instance of this class will be passed
    to the SmartInspect.Error event. Please note, that, if a connections
    string can be read correctly, but is found to be invalid then this
    exception type will not be used. The SmartInspect.LoadConnections
    method will use the SIInvalidConnectionsException exception instead.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
