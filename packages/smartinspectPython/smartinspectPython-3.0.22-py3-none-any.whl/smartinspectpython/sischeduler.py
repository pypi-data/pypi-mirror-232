    """
    Responsible for scheduling protocol operations and executing
    them asynchronously in a different thread of control.

    This class is used by the SIProtocol.IsValidOption to asynchronously execute
    protocol operations. New commands can be scheduled for execution with
    the Schedule method. The scheduler can be started and stopped
    with the Start and Stop methods. The scheduler uses a size
    limited queue to buffer scheduler commands. The maximum size of
    this queue can be set with the Threshold property. To influence
    the behavior of the scheduler if new commands are enqueued and
    the queue is currently considered full, you can specify the
    Throttle mode.

    Threadsafety:
        This class is guaranteed to be thread-safe.
