"""
This is a simple UDF to demonstrate local parallel processing with multiprocessing.

In add_signals specify either processes=True to use processes equal to the number
of CPUs/cores on your current machine, or processes=N for N processes.
The default if processes is not specified is to run single-threaded.

The UDF specified in add_signals will then be run in parallel across all these
worker processes, no other code changes are needed.

Benchmark results showed an almost 8X speedup on a MacBook Pro, using this test, with
parallel processing reducing execution time from a median of 377s to 48s total.

To install script dependencies: pip install tabulate
