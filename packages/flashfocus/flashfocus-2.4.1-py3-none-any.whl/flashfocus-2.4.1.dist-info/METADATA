# flashfocus

Simple focus animations for tiling window managers.

![Demo gif](demo/demo.gif)

<br>

Compatible with sway as well as all X based window managers (i3, bspwm, awesome-wm, xmonad...).


Flashfocus is currently pretty stable and I don't have any major features in
the works, however the project is still actively maintained and feature
requests are always welcome :)

## Installation

For X based window managers, an active window compositor is required for the effects of flashfocus
to be noticeable. If you don't have one setup already, I recommend
[picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom).

### Arch

Install from the Arch User Repository: `flashfocus`

### Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-cffi
pip install flashfocus
```

### Fedora

```
dnf install libffi-devel python-devel python-cffi
pip install flashfocus
```

### openSUSE
Flashfocus is in the official repository of openSUSE Tumbleweed.
openSUSE Leap users can install it from the [X11:Utilities](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11%3AUtilities/flashfocus) devel project:

```
zypper ar obs://X11:Utilities x11util
zypper ref
zypper in flashfocus
```

### Nix / NixOS

Declaratively in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`

```
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  flashfocus
];
```

Ad hoc

```
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.flashfocus
```

## Quickstart

#### Picom setup

The following must be present in your picom config file:

```
detect-client-opacity = true;
```

If you use i3, the following is also required for flashfocus to work with tabbed containers:

```
opacity-rule = [
  "0:_NET_WM_STATE@:32a *= '_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN'"
];
```

#### Running flashfocus

Flashfocus should be added to your startup programs. E.g for i3 place the
following in your config:

```
exec_always --no-startup-id flashfocus
```

The `flash_window` script can be used to flash the current window on key-press. E.g if you'd like to bind to mod+n in i3:

```
bindsym $mod+n exec --no-startup-id flash_window
```

## Configuration

Flashfocus can be configured via its config file or with command line parameters. Some features, such as window-specific flash customization, are only available through the config file.

The config file is searched for in the following locations:
1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flashfocus/flashfocus.yml
2. ~/.config/flashfocus/flashfocus.yml
3. ~/.flashfocus.yml

When flashfocus is first run it creates a default config file in 1. or 2. Documentation of all configuration options is present in the config file.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fennerm/flashfocus/wiki) for some extra docs.
