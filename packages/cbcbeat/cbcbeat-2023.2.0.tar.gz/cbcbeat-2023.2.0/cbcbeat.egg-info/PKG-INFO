cbcbeat is a collection of Python-based solvers for cardiac
electrophysiology models. cbcbeat offers basic and optimized solvers for
the bidomain and monodomain equations coupled with cardiac cell models.
cbcbeat is based on the FEniCS Project and dolfin-adjoint.

## Installation:

See separate file ./INSTALL for how to install the cbcbeat module and a
list of dependencies.

## Documentation:

The cbcbeat documention is availble on readthedocs, see:

> https://computationalphysiology.github.io/cbcbeat/

For manually updating the API and demo documentation, run:

> cd doc make html

assuming that cbcbeat and the optional dependency Sphinx
(sphinx-doc.org) is installed.

## Automated Testing:

cbcbeat uses GitHub Actions for automated and continuous testing:
