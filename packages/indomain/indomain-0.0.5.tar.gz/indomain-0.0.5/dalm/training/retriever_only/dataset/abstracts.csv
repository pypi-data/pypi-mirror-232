Title	Abstract
Casing apparatus having wireless communication function for mobile terminal	The present invention relates to a casing apparatus having the wireless communication function for a mobile terminal, comprising a casing apparatus body, and an antenna, a communication PCBA, and a battery supplying power to the communication PCBA that are arranged in the casing apparatus body; the communication PCBA is integrated with a digital communication module and a WIFI communication module, and the antenna and the battery are respectively connected to the communication PCBA. The casing apparatus according to the present invention transmits a WIFI signal from a tablet computer through the antenna to the WIFI communication module for processing, then transmits the processed signal to the digital communication module for modulation, and finally radiates the modulated signal through the antenna to access a wireless communication network. In this way, the WIFI signal from the tablet computer gets to access the network, thereby realizing the wireless access to the network even though there is no WIFI hotspot available.
Method and an apparatus for machining optical components	An apparatus and a method of machining optical components such as lens is disclosed. The apparatus comprises an optical raw stock or material, a rotatable holding shaft for holding the optical raw stock, a machining tool having a machining surface thereof held by a rotatable machining shaft and arranged opposite to a surface to be machined of the optical raw stock, an electrically conductive tool as the machining tool, an electrode arranged at a certain distance from the machining surface of the conductive tool, an electrolytic power supply source for applying a positive voltage to the conductive tool and a negative voltage therefrom to the electrode, respectively, and a coolant supplying unit having a nozzle and for spraying weakly conductive coolant between the conductive tool and the electrode, thereby performing the machining of the optical raw stock or material.
Methods and apparatus to validate valve position parameters	Methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture to validate position parameters of a valve are disclosed. An example apparatus includes a field device, the field device further including a sensor interface to receive an unprocessed valve position parameter from a sensor and a position comparator to determine a deviation between the unprocessed valve position parameter and an interpreted valve position parameter and a valve position validator apparatus, the valve position validator apparatus further including a parameter comparator to determine if the deviation exceeds a threshold and an alert generator to generate an alert when the parameter comparator determines the deviation exceeds the threshold.
Organometallic catalyst complex and polymerization method employing same	A novel class of organometallic complexes can be used as an ingredient of a catalyst system. The catalyst system can be used in polymerizations of ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers that include both olefins and polyenes.
Process for the downhole upgrading of extra heavy crude oil	A down hole hydroconversion process improves the viscosity, API gravity, and distillate proportions of heavy crude oils by employing a hydrogen donor, methane and steam down hole wherein the mineral formation down hole acts as a catalyst for the hydroconversion process.
Automatic machine for ironing trousers such as jeans or elasticized or sports trousers	The present invention relates to an automatic machine which has been specifically designed for ironing trousers free of folds, preferably of a jeans type, or made of elasticized or sports fabrics, which machine comprises a bearing framework rotatably supporting thereon a plurality of operating assemblies for supporting the cloth articles being ironed, each operating assembly being programmable to automatically perform a plurality of different operations, depending on the type of the trouser fabric and their size.
Gripper for clamping plates, used in combination with a manipulator arm, and offset balancing module	A gripper is disclosed. The gripper has a frame which is connected to a mobile subassembly including a fixed end and a mobile end respectively secured to a fixed arm and a mobile arm, and an actuator supported on the fixed arm for moving the mobile arm and end relative to the fixed arm and end, along a first degree of freedom, in translation or rotation, and a balancing module introducing an additional degree of freedom, in translation or rotation, which is offset outwards of the assembly formed by the mobile subassembly and the frame.
Ceramic body and ceramic catalyst body	A ceramic body that can support a required amount of catalyst component, without lowering the characteristics such as strength, manufactured without forming a coating layer and providing a high performance ceramic catalyst body that is excellent in practical utility and durability. This ceramic body is made by substituting at least one of the constituent elements of cordierite that constitutes the substrate ceramic, for example Al, with W that is the element having an empty orbit in d or f orbit, has high bonding strength and is less susceptible to deterioration since the catalyst component Pt is supported by means of chemical bonding.
Efficient readout from analog memory cells using data compression	A method for data storage includes storing data in a group of analog memory cells by writing respective input storage values to the memory cells in the group. After storing the data, respective output storage values are read from the analog memory cells in the group. Respective confidence levels of the output storage values are estimated, and the confidence levels are compressed. The output storage values and the compressed confidence levels are transferred from the memory cells over an interface to a memory controller.
Exercise device with removable weight	An exercise device in which removable weight may be provided in a housing of the device. Two rotatable handles may be provided in the housing, permitting various hand orientations during exercise. The removable weight may be received within and/or removed from a cavity of the device.
