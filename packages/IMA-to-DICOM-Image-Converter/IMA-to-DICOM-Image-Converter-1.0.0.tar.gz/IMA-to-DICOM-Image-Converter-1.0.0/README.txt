# IMA to DICOM/Image Converter

The IMA to DICOM/Image Converter is a Python library designed to convert .IMA files, typically used for medical images, into DICOM (.dcm) files or various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. This library is especially useful when dealing with medical imaging data and the need to convert it into different formats for analysis or visualization.

## Installation

You can install the IMA to DICOM/Image Converter using pip:

```bash
pip install IMA-to-DICOM-Image-Converter
Usage
To use this library, you can follow these basic steps:

Import the required modules and classes:

import pydicom
from IMA_to_DICOM_Image_Converter import IMAConverter
Create an instance of the IMAConverter class, providing the path to your .IMA file:

ima_converter = IMAConverter("path/to/your/file.ima")


Convert .IMA to DICOM:

ima_converter.converter_ImaToDicom("path/to/save/dicom.dcm")


Convert .IMA to other image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF):

ima_converter.IMA_to_jpg("path/to/save/image.jpg")
ima_converter.IMA_to_png("path/to/save/image.png")
ima_converter.IMA_to_tif("path/to/save/image.tif")


Display .IMA image frames:

ima_converter.show_IMA_ImageFrame()

Extract metadata to a dictionary:

metadata = ima_converter.IMA_MetaData_ToDict()

Examples
Here are some examples of how to use this library:


# Convert .IMA to DICOM
ima_converter.converter_ImaToDicom("output.dcm")

# Convert .IMA to JPEG
ima_converter.IMA_to_jpg("output.jpg")

# Display .IMA image frame
ima_converter.show_IMA_ImageFrame()

# Extract metadata to a dictionary
metadata = ima_converter.IMA_MetaData_ToDict()
