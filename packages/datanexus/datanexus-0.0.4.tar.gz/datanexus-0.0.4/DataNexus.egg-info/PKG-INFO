# DataNexus

DataNexus is a simple to use Python module that you can use in your projects to get transcripts, datasets, etc.
The module also allows you to extract character lines from transcripts witch makes it easyer for you to be able to do finetunning of a GPT2 model as an example.

## Key feactures
- Downloading of Datasets and Transcripts
- Extract Characters from Transcripts

print(model)
```

### Extract character's from transcripts
```py
