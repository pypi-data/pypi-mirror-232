2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone
cd wordcab-transcribe
```

3. Install dependencies and start coding

```bash
hatch env create
```

4. Run tests

```bash
# Quality checks without modifying the code
hatch run quality:check

# Quality checks and auto-formatting
hatch run quality:format

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run tests:run
```

### Working workflow

4. Make changes and commit.
5. Push the branch to GitHub.
6. Create a pull request and ask for review.
7. Merge the pull request when it's approved and CI passes.
8. Delete the branch.
