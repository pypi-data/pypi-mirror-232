# vaticinator(6)

Vaticinator is yet another Python implementation of the
ancient and (in)famous `fortune` program from the 
`bsdgames` package.

My motivation for writing it was more to have a 
portable library I could use to fetch fortunes for
use in other projects.  It's possible that one or
more of the existing ones have this (I looked
albeit briefly), but it was an itch I didn't mind
scratching.

Still alpha maturity level, though the majority of
`fortune` behavior is implemented at the moment.
