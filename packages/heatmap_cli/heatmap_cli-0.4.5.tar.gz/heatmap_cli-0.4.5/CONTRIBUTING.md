## Setting up local development

Clone repository from GitHub:

```console
git clone https://github.com/kianmeng/heatmap_cli
cd heatmap_cli
```

To set up different Python environments, we need to install all supported
Python version using <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>.

Once you've installed `pyenv`, install these additional `pyenv` plugins:

```console
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-doctor.git "$(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-doctor"
pyenv doctor

git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-update.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-update
pyenv update
```

Run the command below to install all Python versions:

```console
pyenv install $(cat .python-version)
```

Install necessary packages:

```console
python -m pip install --upgrade pip pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

Spawn a shell in virtual environment for your development:

```console
pipenv shell
```

Show all available tox tasks:

```console
tox -av
```

```console
...
default environments:
py38  -> testing against python3.8
py39  -> testing against python3.9
py310 -> testing against python3.10
py311 -> testing against python3.11

additional environments:
cov   -> generate code coverage report in html
doc   -> generate sphinx documentation in html
```

For code linting, we're using `pre-commit`:

```console
pre-commit install # run once
pre-commit clean
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or specific hook:

```console
pre-commit run pylint -a
```
