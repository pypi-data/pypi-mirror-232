Welcome to jinn's documentation!
================================

Changelog:

* v0.2.1

    - Introduce non homogeneous equation parameters

    - Improve dynamic losses with generic operators

    - Minor fixes and improvements

* v0.2.0

    - Implement a vanilla version of Resisual Adaptative Resampling scheme as proposed in *DeepXDE: A deep learning library for solving differential equations*, Lu Lu et al., SIAM Review, 2021

    - Implement metamodel learning, i.e., a parameter of the PDE/ODE is input of the neural  network and the dynamic loss is minimized for all the values of that parameter. For example, this is studied in *Surrogate modeling for fluid flows based  on physics-constrained deep learning without simulation data*, Sun et al. 2020

    - Implement seq2seq learning for ODE, based on the article *Characterizing possible failure modes in physics-informed neural networks*, Krishnapriyan et al., NeurIPS 2021

    - New notebooks to illustrate these approaches

    - Minor bug fixes and code improvements
    - Doc improvements

* v0.1.0

    * Initial release
