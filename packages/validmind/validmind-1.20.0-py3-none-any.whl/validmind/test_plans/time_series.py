        This test plan provides a preliminary understanding of the target variable(s)
        used in the time series dataset. It visualizations that present the raw time
        series data and a histogram of the target variable(s).

        The raw time series data provides a visual inspection of the target variable's
        behavior over time. This helps to identify any patterns or trends in the data,
        as well as any potential outliers or anomalies. The histogram of the target
        variable displays the distribution of values, providing insight into the range
        and frequency of values observed in the data.

        This test plan provides a preliminary understanding of the features

        designed to explore the relationships between multiple features
        simultaneously. They allow you to quickly identify any patterns or

        The individual feature distribution can also be explored to provide
        insight into the range and frequency of values observed in the data.

        This test plan computes predictions from statsmodels OLS linear regression models against a list of models and plots the historical data alongside the forecasted data. The purpose of this test plan is to evaluate the performance of each model in predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. By comparing the historical values with the forecasted values, users can visually assess the accuracy of each model and determine which one best fits the data. In addition, this test plan can help users identify any discrepancies between the models and the actual data, allowing for potential improvements in model selection and parameter tuning.

        This test plan performs sensitivity analysis on a statsmodels OLS linear regression model by applying distinct shocks to each input variable individually and then computing the model's predictions. The aim of this test plan is to investigate the model's responsiveness to variations in its inputs. By juxtaposing the model's predictions under baseline and shocked conditions, users can visually evaluate the sensitivity of the model to changes in each variable. This kind of analysis can also shed light on potential model limitations, including over-reliance on specific variables or insufficient responsiveness to changes in inputs. As a result, this test plan can provide insights that may be beneficial for refining the model structure, improving its robustness, and ensuring a more reliable prediction performance.
