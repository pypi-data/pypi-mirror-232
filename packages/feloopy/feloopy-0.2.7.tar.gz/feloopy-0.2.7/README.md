| ![FelooPy Logo](miscellaneous/logo/logo1.png) |  **FelooPy** (pronounced /f…õlupa…™/) is a comprehensive Python library that automates operations research. It serves as a hyper-optimization interface and an integrated optimization environment. FelooPy offers practical solutions for various systems, industries, and supply chains, focusing on finding feasible solutions, logical decisions, and optimal outcomes using Python. The name is a nod to "loops" in programming and algorithm development and "floppy" disk in computing and memory efficiency. FelooPy helps operations research scientists achieve their goals by providing various models and algorithms. In summary, FelooPy is a comprehensive framework for single- and multi-criteria decision-making methods, mathematical modeling, optimization algorithms, and analytics. |

FelooPy requires Python 3.10 or later to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed or a Python interpreter with the necessary version, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, if you are using an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, you can create a new environment with Python 3.10 or later and install FelooPy in that environment, as follows:

```
conda create --name your_environment python=3.10
conda activate your_environment
pip install feloopy
```

FelooPy (v0.2.7) has a few optional dependencies that can be installed using the following commands (recommended to install if possible):

For multi-objective optimization, you should use the linux command for installation. However, please note that the optional dependencies for the Linux kernel might not work on some operating systems. As a workaround, before using the linux command, you can use an Anaconda-based interpreter to install sub-dependencies for multi-objective optimization. For instance, one of such dependencies is the `pygmo` package, which is easier to be installed by the `conda` package manager as follows (see the [official website](https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/install.html) for more details):

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda install pygmo
```
