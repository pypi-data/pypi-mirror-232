# Cardia

Welcome to Cardia, a Python-based library designed for building large AI-executable systems. Code cards, compact files containing a single class or function along with unit tests, serve as executable building blocks for AI agents, enabling them to execute tasks more efficiently.

## Features

- **Effortless System Building**: Cardia simplifies the process of constructing large, AI-executable systems by breaking them down into manageable code cards.

- **Intelligent Code Execution**: The library enables AI agents to execute tasks with precision and efficiency, thanks to the modular nature of code cards.

- **Seamless Code Transformation**: Easily convert existing code into code cards, allowing for swift integration into your AI-powered projects.

- **Enhanced Code Reusability**: Code cards promote reusability, accelerating the development of complex systems and fostering collaborative coding practices.

- **Robust Unit Testing Support**: Each code card includes comprehensive unit tests, ensuring code integrity and reliability throughout development.
