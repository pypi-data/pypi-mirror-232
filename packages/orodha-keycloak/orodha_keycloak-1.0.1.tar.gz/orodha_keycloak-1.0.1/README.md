# Orodha-Keycloak

[This package](https://github.com/Edison-Stuart/orodha-deployment/tree/main/orodha-keycloak) is a facade interfacing with [python-keycloak](https://python-keycloak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) used by
Orodha services in order to make requests to a keycloak server.

## Requirements

Along with the requirements in the requirements.txt file, in order for this package to function properly you need to configure
keycloak in a certain way.

[Here is a tutorial for setting up keycloak clients and service accounts with the keycloak CLI.](https://medium.com/@mihirrajdixit/getting-started-with-service-accounts-in-keycloak-c8f6798a0675)

The long and short of it is that in order for this package to work you need to set up a keycloak Realm, that has at least one client which you configure to use a confidential access type and secret_key, along with the ability to use service accounts.

Once you do this, you have to give you service account the required permissions for

-   creating users
-   deleting users
-   querying users
-   decoding tokens

## Usage

In order to download this package, you simply have to run the command

`python3 -m pip install orodha-keycloak`

After downloading the package you can import it to a file with the statement

`from orodha_keycloak import OrodhaKeycloakClient`

You can find further descriptions of this class in the following section as well as
the method class and method docstrings for the class.

## Description

This package contains one main class, OrodhaKeycloakClient.
The class expects the following arguments upon instantiation:

-   server_url: the main url for our keycloak server. example: `http://keycloak:{port}/auth/`
-   realm_name: The name of the keycloak realm that you want to interfacing with.
-   client_id: The client_id of the keycloak client for your service worker you want to use.

The next three are special. in order to create a connection you either have to pass a client_secret_key to the class,
or you have to pass a username and a password to the class. If you do not have one of these two choices you will get an error.

-   client_secret_key: Obtained from keycloak, used for connecting securely to the keycloak client.
-   username / password: The username and password of a keycloak user that you want to log in as in order to
    take actions on the keycloak realm.

The current methods available on this class are:

-   add_user: Adds a user to keycloak with a password.
-   delete_user: Deletes a keycloak user with a given user_id.
-   get_user: Takes either a user_id or a token and returns the user if they exist.
-   decode_jwt: Small helper function which decodes a JWT token using the client connection.

but more may be added in future versions.
