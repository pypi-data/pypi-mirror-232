# Qat (Qt Application Tester)

## Description
Qat is a testing framework for Qt-based applications.

Qat provides a Python API to interact with any existing Qt application by accessing QML/QtQuick widgets and simulating user manipulations.

It is also integrated to [behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) to support Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

Although Qat uses the GUI to interact with the tested application, it is oriented towards BDD and functional testing rather than pure UI or non-regression testing.

The main objective of Qat is to provide quick feedback to developers and easy integration to build systems:
- It runs as fast as possible
- It can run on virtual displays (linux only)
- It can run tests in parallel

## Installation

Qat can be installed with Pip:
```bash
pip install qat
```
This will also install the following dependencies:
- behave (for BDD testing)
- sv_ttk (for GUI)

## Requirements
Qat requires Python >= 3.9.

Tested applications don't need to be modified but they must be compiled in release mode with a supported compiler and dynamically-linked Qt version:

| Qt | Linux (gcc) | Windows (MSVC) |
|----|-------------|----------------|
| __5.15 (LTS)__ | __yes__ | __yes__ |
| __6.0__ | _no_ | _no_ |
| __6.1__ | __yes__ | __yes__ |
| __6.2 (LTS)__ | __yes__ | __yes__ |
| __6.3__ | __yes__ | __yes__ |
| __6.4__ | __yes__ | _no_ |
| __6.5 (LTS)__ | __yes__ | __yes__ |

Other versions/platforms/compilers may be added upon request.

## Setup

The recommended approach is to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the following extensions:
- Python
- Pylance
- Test Explorer UI
- Behave VSC (for BDD)

Any Python (+ Gherkin) environment can be used (PyCharm, Eclipse/Pydev, VSCode, ...) but the present documentation will use VSCode as a tutorial.

## Usage

### Creating a test
Once Qat is installed and setup is completed, navigate to the folder where you want to store your tests. From there, open a command prompt and run:
```bash
qat-create-suite
```

That will generate all the files to run a demo BDD test.

If you prefer using a pure Python test, run:
```bash
qat-create-suite script
```

Then you need to register the application you want to test. The easiest way is to use the Qat GUI, but you can also use the [Python API](./doc/Python%20API%20reference.md).
In the current test folder, run the following command:
```bash
qat-gui
```

This will open the _Application Manager_ window:
!["App Mgr"](./doc/images/app_mgr.png)

Click on !["Add app"](./client/qat/gui/images/add_icon.png "Add app") and enter an application name in the top combobox, then the application path and arguments in the fields below.
!["App Mgr"](./doc/images/new_app.png)

Click on !["Save"](./client/qat/gui/images/save_icon.png "Save") to register the application.

Now you can close the window and launch VSCode:
```bash
code .
```

### Running a test

The Python demo can be run like any other script: open _demo.py_ in VSCode then click on _Run Python file_. For real tests, it is recommended to use a test framework such as __Pytest__ or __Unittest__.

The BDD demo can be launched from the _Test Explorer_:
!["VSCode BDD demo"](./doc/images/vscode_demo.png "VSCode BDD demo")

In both cases, the demo will verify that an application has been registered (see previous steps), start it and verify that the main window is opened. An XML report will also be generated.

When the demo is successful, it confirms that Qat is properly working on your machine. Otherwise, please refer to the test itself for indications on how to solve the issue.


### Configuring test execution
Test settings are available in _testSettings.py_.
The easiest way to change these values is to add a _testSettings.json_ file to the root of your test suite.

This file can contain the following parameters:
```json
{
   "waitForObjectTimeout": 3000,
   "waitForAppStartTimeout": 60000,
   "waitForAppStopTimeout": 30000,
   "longOperationTimeout": 10000,
   "screenshotOnFail": true,
   "continueAfterFail": false
}
```
If a key is missing, the default value will be used.
If a value is set, it will be available in _testSettings.py_. 

If you need to access those values from a script, you can add the following import to your script:

```python
from qat import testSettings
```

All timeouts are in milliseconds.

__screenshotOnFail__ determines whether a screenshot of the application is taken and added to the report after each failure. Default is __True__.

__continueAfterFail__ determines whether the test execution should continue after a step has failed (BDD only). Default is __False__
