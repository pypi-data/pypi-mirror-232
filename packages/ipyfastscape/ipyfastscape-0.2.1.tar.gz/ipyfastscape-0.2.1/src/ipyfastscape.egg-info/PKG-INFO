# Ipyfastscape

Interactive widgets for topographic data analysis and modelling in Jupyter notebooks.

While ipyfastscape is tightly integrated with [fastscape](https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscape),
it also integrates very well with any data in the form of an [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray)
dataset or any model created with [xarray-simlab](https://github.com/benbovy/xarray-simlab).

The widgets available here are built on top of libraries of the jupyter's widget
ecosystem such as [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)
and [ipygany](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipygany). You can reuse those
high-level UI components as-is within notebooks (embedded mini-apps) or for
building interactive dashboards that you can then publish as standalone web
applications (using [voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)).

## Features

- `TopoViz3d`: Paraview-like 3D terrain visualization, with time player and dimension explorer

- `AppLinker`: Easily link different application instances for, e.g., side-by-side comparison
