`wikiteam3` is a fork of `mediawiki-scraper`.

## Why we fork mediawiki-scraper

Originally, mediawiki-scraper was named wikiteam3, but wikiteam upstream (py2 version) suggested that the name should be changed to avoid confusion with the original wikiteam.  
Half a year later, we didn't see any py3 porting progress in the original wikiteam, and mediawiki-scraper lacks "code" reviewers.  
So, we decided to break that suggestion, fork and named it back to wikiteam3, put the code here, and release it to pypi wildly.

Everything still under GPLv3 license.

## Installation

```shell
pip install wikiteam3 --upgrade
```

## Dumpgenerator usage

### Downloading a wiki with complete XML history and images

```bash
wikiteam3dumpgenerator http://wiki.domain.org --xml --images
```

### Manually specifying `api.php` and/or `index.php`

If the script can't find itself the `api.php` and/or `index.php` paths, then you can provide them:

```bash
wikiteam3dumpgenerator --api http://wiki.domain.org/w/api.php --xml --images
```

```bash
wikiteam3dumpgenerator --api http://wiki.domain.org/w/api.php --index http://wiki.domain.org/w/index.php \
    --xml --images
```

If you only want the XML histories, just use `--xml`. For only the images, just `--images`. For only the current version of every page, `--xml --curonly`.

### Resuming an incomplete dump

```bash
wikiteam3dumpgenerator \
    --api http://wiki.domain.org/w/api.php --xml --images --resume --path /path/to/incomplete-dump
```

In the above example, `--path` is only necessary if the download path is not the default.

`wikiteam3dumpgenerator` will also ask you if you want to resume if it finds an incomplete dump in the path where it is downloading.

## Using `wikiteam3uploader`

### Requirements

- unbinded port 62954
- 3GB+ RAM (~2.56GB for commpressing)
- 64-bit OS (required by 2G wlog size)

- 7z (`7z-full` with lzma2)
- zstd 1.5.5+ (recommended), v1.5.0-v1.5.4(DO NOT USE), 1.4.8 (minimum)

### Uploader usage

```bash
wikiteam3uploader {YOUR_WIKI_DUMP_PATH}
```

## Checking dump integrity

TODO: xml2titles.py

If you want to check the XML dump integrity, type this into your command line to count title, page and revision XML tags:

```bash
grep -E '<title(.*?)>' *.xml -c;grep -E '<page(.*?)>' *.xml -c;grep \
    "</page>" *.xml -c;grep -E '<revision(.*?)>' *.xml -c;grep "</revision>" *.xml -c
```
  
You should see something similar to this (not the actual numbers) - the first three numbers should be the same and the last two should be the same as each other:

```bash
580
580
580
5677
5677
```

If your first three numbers or your last two numbers are different, then, your XML dump is corrupt (it contains one or more unfinished ```</page>``` or ```</revision>```). This is not common in small wikis, but large or very large wikis may fail at this due to truncated XML pages while exporting and merging. The solution is to remove the XML dump and re-download, a bit boring, and it can fail again.
