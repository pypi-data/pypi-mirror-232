# [Whisper: OpenAI Whisper optimized for mobile and edge](https://pr-119.dl2059zyljmsx.amplifyapp.com/model-zoo/whisper_asr)

Whisper is a state of art speech recognition model from OpenAI [Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main). We present a version that's optimized for mobile and edge inference with the Tetra Platform. TetraWhisper-LargeV2 can transcribe 1 minute of audio in about X seconds when running on M1.


## Example & Usage

1. Install the package via pip:
```
pip install tetra_model_zoo[whisper_asr]
```

2. Load the model & app
```
from tetra_model_zoo.whisper_asr import Model
from tetra_model_zoo.whisper_asr import App

app = App(Model.from_pretrained())
```

See [demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model and app.

Please refer to our [general instructions on using models](../../#tetra-model-zoo)
