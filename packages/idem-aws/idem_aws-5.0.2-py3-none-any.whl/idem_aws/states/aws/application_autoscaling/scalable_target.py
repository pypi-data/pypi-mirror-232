    """Registers or updates a scalable target.

    A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale
    out and scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of resource ID, scalable
    dimension, and namespace.

    When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for minimum and
    maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted within the specified range when scaling starts. Application
    Auto Scaling scaling policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this range.

    After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it again to use other Application Auto Scaling
    operations. To see which resources have been registered, use DescribeScalableTargets. You can also view the
    scaling policies for a service namespace by using DescribeScalableTargets. If you no longer need a scalable
    target, you can deregister it by using DeregisterScalableTarget.

    To update a scalable target, specify the
    parameters that you want to change. Include the parameters that identify the scalable target: resource ID,
    scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request.

    .. Note::
        If you call the RegisterScalableTarget API to update an existing scalable target, Application Auto Scaling
        retrieves the current capacity of the resource. If it is below the minimum capacity or above the maximum
        capacity, Application Auto Scaling adjusts the capacity of the scalable target to place it within these bounds,
        even if you don't include the MinCapacity or MaxCapacity request parameters.

            An Idem name of the resource.

        scaling_resource_id(str):

              the resources. The unique identifier is defined by the service provider.

        min_capacity(int, Optional):
            The minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application
            Auto Scaling can scale in (contract) as needed to the minimum capacity limit in response to
            changing demand. This property is required when registering a new scalable target.

            For certain resources, the minimum value allowed is 0. This includes Lambda provisioned concurrency, Spot
            Fleet, ECS services, Aurora DB clusters, EMR clusters, and custom resources. For all other
            resources, the minimum value allowed is 1. Defaults to None.

        max_capacity(int, Optional):
            The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application
            Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as needed to the maximum capacity limit in response to
            changing demand. This property is required when registering a new scalable target.

            Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service quotas may impose lower limits. Each
            service has its own default quotas for the maximum capacity of the resource. If you want to
            specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For more information, consult the
            documentation for that service. For information about the default quotas for each service, see
            Service Endpoints and Quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Defaults to None.

        role_arn(str, Optional):
            This parameter is required for services that do not support service-linked roles (such as Amazon
            EMR), and it must specify the ARN of an IAM role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify
            the scalable target on your behalf.

            If the service supports service-linked roles, Application
            Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role, which it creates if it does not yet exist. For more
            information, see Application Auto Scaling IAM roles. Defaults to None.

        suspended_state(dict[str, Any], Optional):
            An embedded object that contains attributes and attribute values that are used to suspend and
            resume automatic scaling. Setting the value of an attribute to true suspends the specified
            scaling activities. Setting it to false (default) resumes the specified scaling activities.

            Suspension Outcomes

            * For DynamicScalingInSuspended, while a suspension is in effect, all
              scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.
            * For DynamicScalingOutSuspended, while a suspension is in effect, all scale-out activities that are
              triggered by a scaling policy are suspended.
            * For ScheduledScalingSuspended, while a suspension is in effect,
              all scaling activities that involve scheduled actions are suspended.

            For more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.
            Defaults to None.

            * DynamicScalingInSuspended (bool, Optional):
                Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set
                the value to true if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a scaling
                policy is triggered. The default is false.

            * DynamicScalingOutSuspended (bool, Optional):
                Whether scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set
                the value to true if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add capacity when a scaling
                policy is triggered. The default is false.

            * ScheduledScalingSuspended (bool, Optional):
                Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to true if you don't want Application Auto
                Scaling to add or remove capacity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is false.
