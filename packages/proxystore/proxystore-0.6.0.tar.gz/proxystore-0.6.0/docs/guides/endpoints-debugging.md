# Endpoints Debugging

*Last updated 2 May 2023*

This guide outlines some common trouble-shooting steps to take if you
are encountering issues using ProxyStore Endpoints.

## Test a Local Endpoint

Consider you configured and started an endpoint as follows:
```bash
$ proxystore-endpoint configure myendpoint
INFO: Configured endpoint myendpoint <f4dc841d-377e-4785-8d66-8eade34f63cd>. Start with:
INFO:   $ proxystore-endpoint start myendpoint
$ proxystore-endpoint start myendpoint
INFO: Starting endpoint process as daemon.
INFO: Logs will be written to ~/.local/share/proxystore/myendpoint/log.txt
```

### Check Endpoint Logs
Endpoint logs are written to a directory in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/proxystore` which
in this case is `~/.local/share/proxystore/myendpoint`
(see [`home_dir()`][proxystore.utils.environment.home_dir] for the full
specification).
```bash
$ tail -n 1 ~/.local/share/proxystore/myendpoint/log.txt
INFO  (uvicorn.error) :: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.1.1:8766 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
The logs are the first place to check for any potential issues.

### Monitor the Endpoint
Debug level logging can be enabled when starting the endpoint, and
the endpoint can be run directly in the terminal instead of as a daemon process
via the `--no-detach` flag. These two options are helpful for live monitoring
the endpoint.
```bash
$ proxystore-endpoint --log-level DEBUG start myendpoint --no-detach
```

### Use the Test CLI
The `proxystore-endpoint` CLI provides a `test` subcommand for testing endpoint commands.
See the [CLI Reference](../api/cli.md#proxystore-endpoint-test){target=_blank}.
```bash
$ proxystore-endpoint test myendpoint exists abcdef
INFO: Object exists: False
```
As expected, an object with key `abcdef` does not exist in the store, but
we got a valid response so we know the endpoint is running correctly.
You can also validate that this request was logged by the endpoint.

### Invoke a REST Request
Endpoints serve a REST API so `curl` can be used to check if an endpoint
is accessible. Note the `proxystore-endpoint test` CLI is preferred for
debugging. The correct address the endpoint is listening on can be found in
the logs.
```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/exists?key=abcdef
{"exists": false}
```

## Test a Remote Endpoint

Consider I have an endpoint running on system A with UUID
`aaaa0259-5a8c-454b-b17d-61f010d874d4` and another on System B
with UUID `bbbbab4d-c73a-44ee-a316-58ec8857e83a`.

### Check Relay Server Connections
Both endpoints must be connected to the same relay server to form a peer
connection. First, check the `address` value in the `[relay]` section
is present and set to the correct URI string.
The endpoint config is found in the `config.toml` file in the endpoint
directory (e.g., `~/.local/share/proxystore/myendpoint/config.toml`).
Restart your endpoints if you had to change the configuration.

Second, confirm the endpoint connects to the relay server when started by
checking the endpoint logs for a line like this.
```bash
INFO  (proxystore.p2p.relay_client) :: Established client connection to relay server at ws://localhost:8765 with client uuid=aaaa0259-5a8c-454b-b17d-61f010d874d4 and name=myendpoint
```

### Use the Test CLI
The `proxystore-endpoint test` CLI can be used to establish a peer connection
between two endpoints and invoke remote operations.
Here, we will request the endpoint on system A (named "myendpoint") to invoke
an `exists` operation on the endpoint on system B.
```bash
$ proxystore-endpoint test --remote bbbbab4d-c73a-44ee-a316-58ec8857e83a myendpoint exists abcdef
INFO: Object exists: False
```

You will get an error if the peer connection fails. For example:
```bash
ERROR: Endpoint returned HTTP error code 400. Request to peer bbbbab4d-c73a-44ee-a316-58ec8857e83a failed: ...
```
If this happens, check the logs for both endpoints for further error messages.
