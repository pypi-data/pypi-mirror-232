DustyGlow is a software program designed for absorption (ATTENUATION) and reemission analysis. This README file provides essential information about the project.

## Contributors

- Jean Gomes (Software Developer, Advisor): Jean is primarily responsible for
  the software development and implementation of DustyGlow. He provided
  guidance and served as an advisor throughout the project.

- Catarina Lobo (Co-Advisor): Catarina provided valuable assistance during the
  project. She also help guided in the selection of the sample. She co-advised
  the project, offering insights and expertise.

- André Pinheiro (MSc Student): André contributed to the project as a Master's
  student. He actively participated in the research and test of the code
  DustyGlow.

<td>J.G. uploaded the routines concerning absorption in the UV/Optical. Try to plot them as a function of wavelength from 91 to 15000 Angstroms to see the different behavior of extinction laws.</td></tr>

<tr><td>15/01/2022</td>
<td>J.G. uploaded correction for the reddening laws. We can use as well to compare the extinction package, but it is limited to a few extinction laws.<p>

J.G. added a directory called Literature. Please feel free to include papers of interest.

there was during this year a registration of the PyDust package on the PyPI
library, which is not related to astronomy.</td></tr>
