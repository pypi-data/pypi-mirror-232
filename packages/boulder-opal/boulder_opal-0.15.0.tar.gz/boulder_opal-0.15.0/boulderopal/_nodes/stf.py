class DiscretizeStf(Node):
    r"""
    Create a piecewise-constant function by discretizing a sampleable function.

    Use this function to create a piecewise-constant approximation to a sampleable
    function (obtained, for example, by filtering an initial
    piecewise-constant function).

    Parameters
    ----------
    stf : Stf
        The sampleable function :math:`v(t)` to discretize. The values of the
        function can have any shape. You can also provide a batch of
        functions, in which case the discretization is applied to each
        element of the batch.
    duration : float
        The duration :math:`\tau` over which discretization should be
        performed. The resulting piecewise-constant function has this
        duration.
    segment_count : int
        The number of segments :math:`N` in the resulting piecewise-constant
        function.
    sample_count_per_segment : int, optional
        The number of samples :math:`M` of the sampleable function to take when
        calculating the value of each segment in the discretization. Defaults
        to 1.
    name : str or None, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Pwc
        The piecewise-constant function :math:`w(t)` obtained by discretizing
        the sampleable function (or batch of piecewise-constant functions, if
        you provided a batch of sampleable functions).

    See Also
    --------
    Graph.convolve_pwc : Create an `Stf` by convolving a `Pwc` with a kernel.
    Graph.filter_and_resample_pwc : Filter a `Pwc` with a sinc filter and resample it.
    Graph.identity_stf : Create an `Stf` representing the identity function.
    Graph.sample_stf : Sample an `Stf` at given times.

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting function :math:`w(t)` is piecewise-constant with :math:`N`
    segments, meaning it has segment values :math:`\{w_n\}` such that
    :math:`w(t)=w_n` for :math:`t_{n-1}\leq t\leq t_n`, where :math:`t_n= n \tau/N`.

    Each segment value :math:`w_n` is the average of samples of :math:`v(t)`
    at the midpoints of :math:`M` equally sized subsegments between
    :math:`t_{n-1}` and :math:`t_n`:

    .. math::
        w_n = \frac{1}{M}
        \sum_{m=1}^M v\left(t_{n-1} + \left(m-\tfrac{1}{2}\right) \frac{\tau}{MN} \right).

    The convolution is

    Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the

    time-invariant filter (specified via its time domain kernel :math:`K(t)`)
    to :math:`\alpha(t)`.

class SincConvolutionKernel(Node):
    r"""
    Create a convolution kernel representing the sinc function.

    Use this kernel to eliminate angular frequencies above a certain cutoff.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cutoff_frequency : float or Tensor
        Upper limit :math:`\omega_c` of the range of angular frequencies that you want
        to preserve. The filter eliminates components of the signal that have
        higher angular frequencies.

    Returns
    -------
    ConvolutionKernel
        A node representing the sinc function to use in a convolution.

    See Also
    --------
    Graph.convolve_pwc : Create an `Stf` by convolving a `Pwc` with a kernel.
    Graph.filter_and_resample_pwc : Filter a `Pwc` with a sinc filter and resample it.
    Graph.gaussian_convolution_kernel :
        Create a convolution kernel representing a normalized Gaussian.

    Notes
    -----
    The sinc kernel that this node represents is defined as

    .. math::
        K(t) = \frac{\sin(\omega_c t)}{\pi t}.

    In the frequency domain, the sinc function is constant in the range
    :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]` and zero elsewhere. The filter it represents therefore
    passes angular frequencies only in that range.

    Filter a signal by convolving it with a sinc kernel.

class GaussianConvolutionKernel(Node):
    r"""
    Create a convolution kernel representing a normalized Gaussian.

    Use this kernel to allow angular frequencies in the range roughly determined by
    its width, and progressively suppress components outside that range.

    Parameters
    ----------
    std : float or Tensor
        Standard deviation :math:`\sigma` of the Gaussian in the time domain.
        The standard deviation in the frequency domain is its inverse, so that
        a high value of this parameter lets fewer angular frequencies pass.
    offset : float or Tensor or None, optional
        Center :math:`\mu` of the Gaussian distribution in the time domain.
        Use this to offset the signal in time. Defaults to 0.

    Returns
    -------
    ConvolutionKernel
        A node representing a Gaussian function to use in a convolution.

    See Also
    --------
    Graph.convolve_pwc : Create an `Stf` by convolving a `Pwc` with a kernel.
    Graph.sinc_convolution_kernel : Create a convolution kernel representing the sinc function.

    Notes
    -----
    The Gaussian kernel that this node represents is defined as:

    .. math::
        K(t) = \frac{e^{-(t-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}.

    In the frequency domain, this Gaussian has standard deviation
    :math:`\omega_c= \sigma^{-1}`. The filter it represents therefore
    passes angular frequencies roughly in the range :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]`.
