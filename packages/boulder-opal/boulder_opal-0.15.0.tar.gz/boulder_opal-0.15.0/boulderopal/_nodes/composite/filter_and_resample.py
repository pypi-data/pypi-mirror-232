    r"""
    Filter a piecewise-constant function by convolving it with a kernel and resample it again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : Graph
        The graph object where the node will belong.
    pwc : Pwc
        The piecewise-constant function :math:`\alpha(t)` to be filtered.
    kernel : ConvolutionKernel
        The node representing the kernel :math:`K(t)`.
    segment_count : int
        The number of segments of the resampled filtered function.
    duration : float or None, optional
        Force the resulting piecewise-constant function to have a certain duration.
        This option is mainly to avoid floating point errors when the total duration is
        too small. Defaults to the sum of segment durations of `pwc`.
    name : str or None, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Pwc
        The filtered and resampled piecewise-constant function.

    See Also
    --------
    :func:`Graph.convolve_pwc` :
        Create the convolution of a piecewise-constant function with a kernel.
    :func:`Graph.discretize_stf` :
        Create a piecewise-constant function by discretizing a sampleable function.
    :func:`Graph.sinc_convolution_kernel` :
        Create a convolution kernel representing the sinc function.

    Notes
    -----
    The convolution is

    .. math::
        (\alpha * K)(t) \equiv
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty \alpha(\tau) K(t-\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau.

    Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the
    frequency domain, so this function can be viewed as applying a linear
    time-invariant filter (specified via its time domain kernel :math:`K(t)`)
    to :math:`\alpha(t)`.
