# Official OpenWeedLocator Toolkit
Simplifying the integration of weed detection into your platform.

[![OWL-tools](https://github.com/geezacoleman/openweedlocator-tools/actions/workflows/owl-testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geezacoleman/openweedlocator-tools/actions/workflows/owl-testing.yml)

## Overview
The OpenWeedLocator (OWL) is an open-source weed detection device for low-cost, 
DIY site-specific weed management. Here, we're making the software that supports 
the OWL more accesible with an easy-to-use API, so you can integrate weed detection 
into your own devices and services more easily by simply calling 
`GreenonBrown.find()`.

Currently, it supports green-on-brown detection on all platforms, and green-on-green
on desktops through the Ultralytics package.

In the future, we will support plant counting, GPS integration and green-on-green 
on edge devices (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi)
