"""
A collection of classes and interfaces supporting the construction of data transfer objects for moving data between
HEA microservices as well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. The HEAObject is the root
interface for these data transfer objects, and AbstractHEAObject provides a root abstract implementation for them.

class HEAObject(abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA microservices as
    well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior except support
    for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides default
    implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    HEA objects have built-in facilities for extracting the object's non-callable attributes into a dictionary or a
    JSON string (the to_dict() and to_json() methods, respectively). These methods are used by other parts of HEA to
    build REST API responses. Dynamically created attributes are not guaranteed to appear in the return values of these
    methods, nor may they appear in the get_attributes() and get_all_attributes() methods. A future version of this
    library may break the current behavior of dynamically created attributes, thus they should be avoided for now.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Member objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example member objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part. HEA objects may contain only one
    level of nested members.

    HEA objects must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. Attribute values may be strings, numbers, booleans,
    enums, or a HEA object; or a list of strings, numbers, booleans, enums, or HEA objects. Attributes of type enum
    must be implemented as a property with a setter that accepts both strings and the enum values, and will convert the
    strings to enum values.

    In general, HEA objects implement composition relationships by making the container a desktop object and the "owned"
    object a member object. Other association relationships are implemented by storing the id of the associated object
    rather than nesting it. By convention, the id attributes are named hea_object_class_name_id, where hea_object_class_name
    is the name of the class converted from camel case to underscores. There is one exception to this convention in the
    heaobject library. Item objects contain a nested copy of the desktop object that they refer to.

    Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject.

    Properties of a HEAObject must never raise an error because another property is unset. This restriction may be
    lifted in a future version of heaobject.

    In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations throughout.

    It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA microservice as themselves, which
    will filter any nested member objects that are returned according to their permissions.

class DesktopObject(HEAObject, abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for objects that can appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, with those permissions
    represented by owned objects implementing the MemberObject interface. Other attributes may also employ owned
    objects. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop
    object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions that use specific desktop object types.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    Desktop objects may employ three authorization mechanisms:

    1) User-based: if the user is the object's owner, then the user can do anything with the object.
    2) Shares-based: if the owner has shared the object with a user, then the user can use the object according to the
    values of the heaobject.root.Permission enum.
    3) Dynamic permissions: Implemented using the dynamic_permission function, it uses the object's field values to
    determine the user's permissions. It will only be invoked if the user has some level of shares-based permission. In
    the absence of the object actually having been shared with a user, a Share object can be added to the shares list
    with user system|all and the minimum permission level (CHECK_DYNAMIC). In the future, it may be possible to
    traverse relationships between objects via their *_id fields so that related objects' field values might be used to
    determine permissions.

    The level of permissions granted will be the greatest of the 3 approaches. Being an object's owner trumps
    everything. The shares-based and dynamic permissions-based approaches both return heaobject.root.Permission objects,
    and in the event of conflicting Permissions, the most permissive permissions will prevail.

    Desktop objects may have a class variable, associations, with type Dict[property, str]. For properties ending in
    _id or _ids that represent an association relationship with another desktop object type, it defines the type name
    of the desktop object being referred to. The associations variable is intended to have many purposes. In the future,
    implementations of the dynamic_permission() method might use these annotations to traverse an association
    relationship to another desktop object as part of permissions checking.
    """

    @property  # type: ignore
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def id(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        The object's resource unique identifier. It must be unique among all
        objects of the same type. The id is expected to be generated by the
        database in which the objects are stored, thus prior to storing the
        object the id is expected to be None. In a client-server application,
        the id is generated on the server side and provided back to the client.

        When an application needs to store updates of an object in a database,
        the application should first arrange to store the original version of
        the object and get its generated id back from the database for use in
        subsequent updates. However, in asynchronous operations this may not be
        possible, such as when an object and updates to it are sent over a
        message queue. In a message queue, the sender may generate updates to
        an object before the receiver finishes processing the original object
        version.

        In this case, the application must generate and maintain its own object
        id, and the object class should provide a different property for the
        application to store it. The database will still generate its id and
        store it in the id field, thus the object will have two unique ids, a
        database-generated id and an application-generated id. Typical methods
        for generating ids on the application side such as UUIDs are highly
        reliable but may be somewhat less reliable over the long term than
        database-generated ids. Thus, applications should use database-
        generated ids whenever feasible and treat application-generated ids as
        temporary. Applications should link the database- and application-
        generated ids. In a client-server application, this must happen server-
        side so that the server can appropriately store objects received from
        the client with only an application-generated id. However, the client
        could maintain its own linkage if necessary.

        In client-server applications with multiple server processes such as
        microservices, application-generated ids should be based upon unique
        identifiers of the source of the object, which depending on the
        architecture might include IP address or other form of host identifier,
        so that objects generated by separate server processes cannot clash.
        Consider security concerns if the generated ids may become visible to
        users.

class AbstractHEAObject(HEAObject, abc.ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA
    microservices as well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior
    except support for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides
    default implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Owned objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example owned objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part.

    HEA object implementations must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. All non-callable instance members must be
    included in the to_dict() and json_dumps() methods. Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all
    non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject. Override __copy__ and __deepcopy__ to change that
    behavior. In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations for all properties and callables.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    View mixin. Views are desktop objects that are automatically managed alternative representations of some other
    desktop object. Acting on a view also acts on the other desktop object, and vice-versa. A desktop object can have
    multiple views served by different endpoints, all of which synchronize with the corresponding desktop object.
    Create a view class by extending both heaobject.root.DesktopObject (or a subclass) and this class. In addition to
    the attributes provided by this mixin, microservices are expected to populate a view's attributes from those of the
    desktop object for all attributes that overlap. Furthermore, submitting a view object to a PUT, POST, or DELETE
    endpoint must also update the corresponding desktop object. A client must be able to work with views and their
    corresponding desktop objects interchangeably, and synchronization between the two must be immediate such that a
    workflow must be able to submit a change to a view and subsequently request the corresponding desktop object,
    and the changes in the view must reflect in the desktop object.

    Views are different from MacOS or Windows aliases. While aliases can be modified and deleted without affecting
    the object that they point to, and changes to an object may or may not affect its aliases, changes to HEA views
    always change the corresponding desktop object and vice-versa. HEA defines an heaobject.root.Alias mixin as a
    placeholder for supporting desktop objects in the future that have similar properties to MacOS and Windows aliases.
