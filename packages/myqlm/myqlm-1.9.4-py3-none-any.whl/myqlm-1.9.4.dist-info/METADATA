# Module myQLM

myQLM is a quantum software stack for writing, simulating, optimizing, and executing quantum programs. Through a Python interface, it provides:

 - **powerful semantics** for [manipulating](https://myqlm.github.io/programming.html#programming) quantum circuits, with support for universal as well as custom gate sets, abstract parameters, advanced linking options, etc.;
 - **a versatile execution stack** for [running quantum jobs](https://myqlm.github.io/simulating.html#simulating), including an easy handling of observables, special plugins for carrying out NISQ-oriented [variational methods](https://myqlm.github.io/running_variational.html#variational) (such as VQE, QAOA), and easy API for [writing customized plugins](https://myqlm.github.io/manipulating.html#manipulating) (e.g for compilation or error mitigation), as well as for connecting to any Quantum Processing Unit (QPU);
 - **a seamless interface** to [available quantum processors and major quantum programming frameworks](https://myqlm.github.io/myqlm_specific/interoperability.html#interop).

myQLM also interfaces with the QLM, for [Quantum Learning Machine](https://atos.net/fr/solutions/quantum-learning-machine), the quantum programming appliance of Atos.


## Prerequisites
This version of myQLM works on both Windows, macOS and Linux for different versions of Python 3. Please look at the [compatibility matrix](https://myqlm.github.io/myqlm_specific/install.html#compatibility-matrix) to ensure myQLM is installable on your computer.

This module can be installed by typing the following command:

```
pip install myqlm
```
