"""
This script is used to segment a request into multiple search queries and perform them asynchronously.
The `Search` class represents a single search query and has the `execute` method to perform the search.
The `MultiSearch` class represents multiple searches and has an `execute` method that runs all the 
searches concurrently using asyncio.
The `segment` function uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to convert a given string into multiple search queries,
which are then run by calling the `execute` method of the returned `MultiSearch` object.

Examples:
>>> queries = segment(
...     "Please send me the video from last week about the investment case study and also documents about your GPDR policy?"
... )
>>> queries.execute()
# Expected output:
# >>> Searching for `Video` with query `investment case study` using `SearchType.VIDEO`
# >>> Searching for `Documents` with query `GPDR policy` using `SearchType.EMAIL`
