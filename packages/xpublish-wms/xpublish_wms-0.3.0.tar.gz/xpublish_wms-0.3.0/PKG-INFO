[Xpublish](https://xpublish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) routers for the [OGC WMS API](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms).

### Documentation and code

*Coming soon*

### Installation

For `conda` users you can

```shell
conda install --channel conda-forge xpublish_wms
```

or, if you are a `pip` users

```shell
pip install xpublish_wms
```

Once it's installed, the plugin will register itself with Xpublish and WMS endpoints will be included for each dataset on the server.

### Dataset Requirements

At this time, only a subset of xarray datasets will work out of the box with this plugin. To be compatible, a dataset must have:

- CF Compliant `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates
- One of:
    - `latitude` and `longitude` dimensions that correspond to the CF compliant coordinates
    - CF compliant SGRID metadata (`topology`)

Currently only regularly spaced lat/lng grids and SGRID grids are supported. If a datasets meets these requirements and does not work, please file an [issue](https://github.com/xpublish-community/xpublish-wms/issues). Pull requests to support other grid systems are encouraged!
