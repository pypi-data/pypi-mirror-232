        Retrieve Feature Effects for the model.

        Feature Effects provides partial dependence and predicted vs actual values for top-500
        features ordered by feature impact score.

        The partial dependence shows marginal effect of a feature on the target variable after
        accounting for the average effects of all other predictive features. It indicates how,
        holding all other variables except the feature of interest as they were,
        the value of this feature affects your prediction.

        Requires that Feature Effects has already been computed with
        :meth:`request_feature_effect <datarobot.models.Model.request_feature_effect>`.

        See :meth:`get_feature_effect_metadata <datarobot.models.Model.get_feature_effect_metadata>`
        for retrieving information the available sources.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : string
            The source Feature Effects are retrieved for.
        include_ice_plots: bool, optional
            Indicates whether Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots should be returned.

        Returns
        -------
        feature_effects : FeatureEffects
           The feature effects data.

        Raises
        ------
        ClientError (404)
            If the feature effects have not been computed or source is not valid value.
