def real_PDB_UI():
    """A user friendly UI to allow for open, minupulating, and then outputting .pdb files.

    Functions:
    
    Open .pdb files:
     - When run, the first thing that will be asked is "Enter pdb file name: []". You must enter the relative / absolute path to the file.
     - Ex: Enter pdb file name: "ioNERDSSPyPi\TestingFunctions\\1si4.pdb" (Note: I have to add a 2nd '\' before 1, so python does not see it as a weird charecter)
    Chaning distance between interaction sites:
     - After the .pdb file in initilized, it will ask "Would you like to chang...", and ask for you to write 'yes' or 'no'
     - If you write yes, keep reading, if you write no, it will just go to the next section
     - Than it will ask 'which distance' you want to change, and ask for an integer between 0-X. 
        - 0: means all distances will be set to the same number you input
        - 1+: That distance will be set to the number inputted. You can find which 'distance' each number refers to by reading and counting down the 
        list of Interaction Sites (which is directly above). 1 = the furthest up.
     - Then enter the new distance.
     - Then the initial message will come up again, and repeats this whol process.
    'Normalizing':
     - It will then ask if you want to see the 'default norm vector to (0,0,1)'. Write 'yes' or 'no' if you do or don't
     - It will then ask if you want each molecule's center of mass to be 0,0,0
     - The UI will then spit out the necessary .mol and .inp files to setup a NERDSS simulation

    If you want to make graphs / new .pdb files, you will need to use the 'seperate' commands instead of the UI.
