    This function will extract the coordinate information stored inside a real PDB file and calculate 
    the COM of each unique chain, as well as recognize the binding information between each pair of chains 
    (all atoms of different unique chains that are closer that 3.0 angstroms are considered as binded), 
    including whether two chains are binded and the coordinates of each binding interface. All the information 
    will be printed on the screen and the returns will contain all the information for further analysis. 

    Args:
        FileName (str): The full path of the desired PDB file or name of the file if in same directory. 
        ChainIncluded (lst): A list of which chains you want to be included

    Returns:
        reaction_chain: list of coordinates to each chains COM. Indicies connect with unique chain.
        int_site: holds interaction site data. [i]: each reaction. [0][i]: each chain involved. [0][0][i]: position of that chains int site
        int_site_distance: distance between each interaction. Indice connects with int_site
        unique_chain: Each chain included
