  and improve solar characteristic spectra removal from solar gain images. (`#105 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/105>`__)
- Improve spatial residuals in polarimetric data by computing a demodulation matrix for every spatial pixel and then
  smoothing the resulting demodulation matrices in the spatial dimension. (`#106 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/106>`__)
- Normalize Q, U, and V polarimetric beams by their respective Stokes-I prior to beam combination, then multiply the combination
  by the average Stokes-I data. (`#107 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/107>`__)
- Improvement to accuracy of beam angle calculation. The angle is now measured directly from the hairlines instead of using a Hough transform,
  which has less accuracy due to the width of the hairlines. (`#108 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/108>`__)
- Use new and improved PAC fit mode for improved polarimetric accuracy. Also update code to support/interact with
  `dkist-processing-pac` >= 2.0.0. This is mostly renaming kwargs on API calls. Also removed unneeded dummy dimensions
  and renamed a matrix multiple function. (`#109 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-visp/pull-requests/109>`__)
