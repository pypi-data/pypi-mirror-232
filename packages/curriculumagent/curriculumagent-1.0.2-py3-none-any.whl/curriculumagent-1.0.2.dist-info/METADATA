CurriculumAgent is a cleanup and improved version of the
[NeurIPS 2020 Competition Agent by binbinchen](https://github.com/AsprinChina/L2RPN_NIPS_2020_a_PPO_Solution).
The agent is build to extract action sets of the Grid2Op Environment and then use rule-based agent to train
a Reinforcement Learning agent. We explain each step in more detail in our paper. 

When using the CurriculumAgent, please cite our paper with.
