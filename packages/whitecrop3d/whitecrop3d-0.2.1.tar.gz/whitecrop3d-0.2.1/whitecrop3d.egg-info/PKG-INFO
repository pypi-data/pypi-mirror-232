# whitecrop3d
## Description
- Crops unnecessary white background from images. Meant to be for 3D models previews. 
- Whitecrop3d was developed as temporary solution for problem of 3D graphics that was time expensive to solve. We worked on solving problem properly after this temporary solution was implemeneted.
## Usage
- Install: `$ pip install whitecrop3d`
- Use: `$ python3 -m whitecrop3d path/to/pngs`
## How it works
Do this for all images in path specified:
1. Loads image
2. Crops the image based on white background
3. Adds background to match original 1024x768 resolution
4. Saves image (inplace)
