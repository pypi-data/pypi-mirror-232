Contains two jax functions ScoreNet32 and ScoreNet64. These are used to return the gradients of an arbitrary image with respect to a prior distribution of individual artifact free galaxy models. Current functions include ScoreNetXX(image) returns gradients as stated. generateSample(samples=n, hi_res=bool, seed=XXXX) will generate an array of n galaxy samples which can be plotted with imshow.
