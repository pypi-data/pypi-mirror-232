# equality-check

```
from equality_check import EQUALITY

EQ = EQUALITY (
	FOLDER ("STATUS_FOLDERS/1/EQ_1"),
	FOLDER ("STATUS_FOLDERS/1/EQ_2")
)
```

If the folders are equal, 
then these assertions should pass.
```
assert (len (EQ ['1']) == 0)
assert (len (EQ ['2']) == 0)
```

Otherwise:
```
#
# UNIQUE TO 1
# UNIQUE TO 2
#
#	"f" 	UNIQUE FILE
#	"fc" 	UNIQUE FILE CONTENTS
#
#	"d"		UNIQUE DIRECTORY
#
#	"s"		UNIQUE SYMLINK
#	"sc"	UNIQUE SYMLINK CONTENTS
#
EQ = {
	1: {
		"asdf/asdf": "f",
		"asdf/asd": "d",
		"asdff/asd": "?"
	},
	2: {}
}
```
