HGDL is an API for HPC distributed constrained function optimization.
At the core, the algorithm uses local and global optimization
and bump-function-based deflation to provide a growing list of unique optima of a differentiable function.
This tackles the common problem of non-uniquness of optimization problems, especially in machine learning.

## Usage

The following demonstrates a simple usage of the HGDL API.

```python
import numpy as np
from hgdl.hgdl import HGDL as hgdl
from hgdl.support_functions import *
import dask.distributed as distributed

bounds = np.array([[-500,500],[-500,500]])
#dask_client = distributed.Client("10.0.0.184:8786")
a = hgdl(schwefel, schwefel_gradient, bounds,
        global_optimizer = "genetic",
        local_optimizer = "dNewton", #put in local optimzers from scipy.optimize.minimize
        number_of_optima = 30000,
        num_epochs = 100)

x0 = np.random.uniform(low = bounds[:, 0], high = bounds[:,1],size = (20,2))
a.optimize(x0 = x0)

###the thread is now released, but the work continues in the background

a.get_latest() ##prints the current result whenever queried

a.kill_client() ##stops the execution and returns the result
```
