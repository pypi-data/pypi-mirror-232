**Work in progress**

U-FISH is an advanced FISH spot calling algorithm based on deep learning. The "U" in U-FISH represents both the U-Net architecture and the Unified output of enhanced images, underpinning our design philosophy. U-FISH has been developed to address the challenges posed by significant variations in experimental conditions, hybridization targets, and imaging parameters across different data sources. These variations result in diverse image backgrounds and varying signal spot features. Conventional algorithms and parameter settings often fall short in accommodating the requirements of all these diverse image types. To overcome this limitation, we have devised a novel image enhancement approach based on the U-Net model, aimed at achieving a standardized output format for images.

Key points about U-FISH:

1. U-FISH was trained and tested on a diverse dataset comprising 4000+ images with approximately 1.6 million targets from seven sources, including 2 simulated datasets and 5 real datasets. This extensive training resulted in achieving state-of-the-art performance.
2. The network architecture has been optimized to achieve this level of performance with a compact model size of only 160k parameters. The ONNX file of the model is only about 680kB in size, making it suitable for inference on edge devices.
3. U-FISH addresses a limitation of other deep learning-based spot calling algorithms by successfully handling 3D data, overcoming a significant drawback in this field.
4. It offers support for large-scale data storage formats such as OME-Zarr and N5, enhancing its versatility and applicability.
5. U-FISH provides a user-friendly interface through APIs, a command-line interface (CLI), a Napari plugin, and an online application, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ufish
```

For inference using GPU, you need to install onnxruntime-gpu:

```bash
pip install onnxruntime-gpu
```

For training using GPU, you need to install PyTorch with CUDA support, see [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/) for details.

## Usage

CLI usage:

```bash
# list all sub-commands:
$ python -m ufish

# using --help to see details of each sub-command, e.g.:
$ ufish predict --help

# predict one image
$ ufish predict input.tiff output.csv

# predict all images in a directory
$ ufish predict-imgs input_dir output_dir

# load a trained model and predict
$ ufish load-weights path/to/weights - predict-imgs input.tiff output.csv

# training from scratch
$ ufish train path/to/train_dir path/to/val_dir --model_save_dir path/to/save/model

# training from a pre-trained model (fine-tuning)
$ ufish load-weights path/to/weights - train path/to/train_dir path/to/val_dir --model_save_dir path/to/save/model
```

API for inference and evaluation:

```python
from skimage import io
from ufish.api import UFish

ufish = UFish()

# loading model weights, this step is optional
ufish.load_weights("path/to/weights")
# or download from huggingface:
# ufish.load_weights_from_internet()

# inference
img = io.imread("path/to/image")
pred_spots, enh_img = ufish.predict(img)

# plot prediction result
fig_spots = ufish.plot_result(img, pred_spots)

# evaluate
true_spots = pd.read_csv("path/to/true_spots.csv")
metrics = ufish.evaluate_result(spots, true_spots)

# plot evaluation result
fig_eval = ufish.plot_evaluate(
    img, pred_spots, true_spots, cutoff=3.0)
```

API for training:

```python
from ufish.api import UFish

ufish = UFish()

# loading a pre-trained model
# if you want to train from scratch, just skip this step
ufish.load_weights("path/to/weights")

ufish.train(
    'path/to/train_dir',
    'path/to/val_dir',
    num_epochs=100,
    lr=1e-4,
    model_save_path='path/to/save/model',
)
```

## Dataset

The dataset is available at [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GangCaoLab/FISH_spots):

```bash
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/GangCaoLab/FISH_spots
```
