'''Module providing a transformation from a PSyIR Array Range to a
PSyIR Loop. This could be useful for e.g. performance reasons, to
allow further transformations e.g. loop fusion or if the back-end does
not support array ranges.

        The natural place to test the equivalence of two ranges is in
        the Range class. However, the test required here is slightly
        different as it is valid to assume that two array slices are
        the same even if their actual sizes are not known (as the code
