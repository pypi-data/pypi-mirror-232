--  Internal package: defines data types and subprograms to provide the
--  implementation of the exported C API (see the corresponding C header file).

private package Librflxlang.Implementation.C is

   subtype rflx_analysis_context is Internal_Context;
   --  This type represents a context for all source analysis. This is the
   --  first type you need to create to use Librflxlang. It will contain the
   --  results of all analysis, and is the main holder for all the data.
   --
   --  You can create several analysis contexts if you need to, which enables
   --  you, for example to:
   --
   --  * analyze several different projects at the same time;
   --
   --  * analyze different parts of the same projects in parallel.
   --
   --  In the current design, contexts always keep all of their analysis units
   --  allocated. If you need to get this memory released, the only option at
   --  your disposal is to destroy your analysis context instance.
   --
   --  This structure is partially opaque: some fields are exposed to allow
   --  direct access, for performance concerns.

   subtype rflx_analysis_unit is Internal_Unit;
   --  This type represents the analysis of a single file.
   --
   --  This type has strong-reference semantics and is ref-counted.
   --  Furthermore, a reference to a unit contains an implicit reference to the
   --  context that owns it. This means that keeping a reference to a unit will
   --  keep the context and all the unit it contains allocated.
   --
   --  This structure is partially opaque: some fields are exposed to allow
   --  direct access, for performance concerns.

   type rflx_base_node is new System.Address;
   --  Data type for all nodes. Nodes are assembled to make up a tree.  See the
   --  node primitives below to inspect such trees.
   --
   --  Unlike for contexts and units, this type has weak-reference semantics:
   --  keeping a reference to a node has no effect on the decision to keep the
   --  unit that it owns allocated. This means that once all references to the
   --  context and units related to a node are dropped, the context and its
   --  units are deallocated and the node becomes a stale reference: most
   --  operations on it will raise a ``Stale_Reference_Error``.
   --
   --  Note that since reparsing an analysis unit deallocates all the nodes it
   --  contains, this operation makes all reference to these nodes stale as
   --  well.

   type rflx_node_kind_enum is new int;
   --  Kind of AST nodes in parse trees.
