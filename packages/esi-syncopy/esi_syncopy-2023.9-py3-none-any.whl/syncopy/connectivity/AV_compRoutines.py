    r"""
    Given the trial averaged cross spectral densities,
    calculates the normalizations to arrive at the
    channel x channel coherencies. If ``S_ij(f)`` is the
    averaged cross-spectrum between channel `i` and `j`, the
    coherency [1]_ is defined as:

    .. math::

          C_{ij} = S_{ij}(f) / (|S_{ii}| |S_{jj}|)

    The coherence is now defined as either ``|C_ij|``
    or ``|C_ij|^2``, this can be controlled with the `output`
    parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csd_av_dat : (nTime, nFreq, N, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Cross-spectral densities for `N` x `N` channels
        and `nFreq` frequencies averaged over trials.
    output : {'abs', 'pow', 'fourier', 'real', 'imag'}, default: 'abs'
        Also after normalization the coherency is still complex (`'complex'`),
        to get the real valued coherence ``0 < C_ij(f) < 1`` one can either take the
        absolute (`'abs'`) or the absolute squared (`'pow'`) values of the
        coherencies. The definitions are not uniform in the literature,
        hence multiple output types are supported. Additionally `'angle'`,
        `'imag'` or `'real'` are supported.
    noCompute : bool
        Preprocessing flag. If `True`, do not perform actual calculation but
        instead return expected shape and :class:`numpy.dtype` of output
        array.

    Returns
    -------
    CS_ij : (nTime, nFreq, N, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Coherence for all channel combinations ``i,j``.
        `N` corresponds to number of input channels.

    Notes
    -----

    This method is intended to be used as
    :meth:`~syncopy.shared.computational_routine.ComputationalRoutine.computeFunction`
    inside a :class:`~syncopy.shared.computational_routine.ComputationalRoutine`.
    Thus, input parameters are presumed to be forwarded from a parent metafunction.
    Consequently, this function does **not** perform any error checking and operates
    under the assumption that all inputs have been externally validated and cross-checked.

    """
    Given the trial averaged cross spectral densities,
    calculates the pairwise Granger-Geweke causalities
    for all (non-symmetric!) channel combinations
    following the algorithm proposed in [1]_.

    First the CSD matrix is factorized using Wilson's
    algorithm, the resulting transfer functions and
    noise covariance matrix is then used to calculate
    Granger causality according to Eq. 8 in [1]_.

    Selection of channels and frequencies of interest
    can and should be done beforehand when calculating the CSDs.

    Critical numerical parameters for Wilson's algorithm
    (`rtol`, `nIter`, `cond_max`) have sensitive defaults,
    which were tested for datasets with up to
    5000 samples and 256 channels. Changing them is
    recommended for expert users only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csd_av_dat : (1, nFreq, N, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Cross-spectral densities for `N` x `N` channels
        and `nFreq` frequencies averaged over trials.
    rtol : float
        Relative error tolerance for Wilson's algorithm
        for spectral matrix factorization. Default should
        be fine for most cases, handle with care!
    nIter : int
        Maximum number of iterations for CSD factorization. A result
        is returned if exhausted also if error tolerance was not met.
    cond_max : float
        The maximal condition number of the spectral matrix.
        The CSD matrix can be almost singular in cases of many channels and
        low sample number. In these cases Wilson's factorization fails
        to converge, as it relies on positive definiteness of the CSD matrix.
        If the condition number is above `cond_max`, a brute force
        regularization is performed until the regularized CSD matrix has a
        condition number below `cond_max`.
    noCompute : bool
        Preprocessing flag. If `True`, do not perform actual calculation but
        instead return expected shape and :class:`numpy.dtype` of output
        array.

    Returns
    -------
    Granger : (1, nFreq, N, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Spectral Granger-Geweke causality between all channel
        combinations. Directionality follows array
        notation: causality from ``i -> j`` is ``Granger[0,:,i,j]``,
        causality from ``j -> i`` is ``Granger[0,:,j,i]``
