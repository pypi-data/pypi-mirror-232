    """
    Perform time-frequency analysis on multi-channel time series data
    using a wavelet transform

    Parameters
    ----------

    data_arr : 2D :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Uniformly sampled multi-channel time-series
        The 1st dimension is interpreted as the time axis
    samplerate : float
        Samplerate of `data_arr` in Hz
    scales : 1D :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Set of scales to use in wavelet transform.
    wavelet : callable
        Wavelet function to use, one of
        :data:`~syncopy.specest.const_def.availableWavelets`

    Returns
    -------
    spec : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Complex time-frequency representation of the input data.
        Shape is (len(scales),) + data_arr.shape

def get_optimal_wavelet_scales(scale_from_period, nSamples, dt, dj=0.25, s0=None):
    """
    Local helper to compute an "optimally spaced" set of scales for wavelet analysis

    Parameters
    ----------
    scale_from_period : func
        Function to convert periods to Wavelet specific scales.
    nSamples : int
        Sample-count (i.e., length) of time-series that is analyzed
    dt : float
        Time-series step-size; temporal spacing between consecutive samples
        (1 / sampling rate)
    dj : float
        Spectral resolution of scales. The choice of `dj` depends on the spectral
        width of the employed wavelet function. For instance, ``dj = 0.5`` is the
        largest value that still yields adequate sampling in scale for the Morlet
        wavelet. Other wavelets allow larger values of `dj` while still providing
        sufficient spectral resolution. Small values of `dj` yield finer scale
        resolution.
    s0 : float or None
        Smallest resolvable scale; should be chosen such that the equivalent
        Fourier period is approximately ``2 * dt``. If `None`, `s0` is computed
        to satisfy this criterion.

    Returns
    -------
    scales : 1D :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Set of scales to use in the wavelet transform, ordered
        from high(low) scale(frequency) to low(high) scale(frequency)

    Notes
    -----
    The calculation of an "optimal" set of scales follows [ToCo98]_.
    This routine is a local auxiliary method that is purely intended for internal
    use. Thus, no error checking is performed.
