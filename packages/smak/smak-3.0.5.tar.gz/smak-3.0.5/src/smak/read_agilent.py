#   version 5.0, June 2017 Alex Henderson. Calculate fpa size from data

#       Changed fopen to be compatible with Octave. 
#   version 4.0, June 2017, Added width and height as outputs and changed

#   version 3.0, August 2012, replaced loop through matrix with permute and

#       version 6.1, June 2017
#       version 6.1, June 2017 Alex Henderson. Modified fopen to be
#       compatible with Octave
#       version 6.0, March 2017 Alex Henderson. Calculate fpa size from data
#       rather than hardcoding as 128x128 pixels
#       version 5.0, May 2016 Alex Henderson, Renamed to agilentMosaic. No
#       change to operational code. 
#       version 4.1, March 2015 Alex Henderson, Small change to fix
#       filename case sensitivity issues on Linux. No other functional
#       changes. 
#       version 4.0, January 2014 Alex Henderson, Moved the data allocation
#       outside the file read loop. Also moved the wavenumber truncation
#       for keepme scenarios outside the file read loop.
#       version 3.0, November 2013 Alex Henderson, Added 'keepme' to allow
#       the data to have spectral regions removed during import
#       version 2.0, August 2012 Alex Henderson, replaced loop through
#       matrix with permute and flipdim
#       version 1.3, December 2011 Alex Henderson, added GPL licence and
#       incorporated the getfilename function
#       version 1.2, November 2011 Alex Henderson, the dmt filename is all
#       lowercase while the other filenames are of mixed case. Now we ask
#       for the .dms filename instead and build a lowercase .dmt filename
#       from that. This was only a problem in Linux. 
#       version 1.1, October 2011 Alex Henderson, the dms file only matches
#       the image if the number of tiles is small. Now we read each tile
#       separately.
