# OpenPoliceData
The OpenPoliceData (OPD) Python library is the most comprehensive centralized public access point for incident-level police data in the United States. OPD provides easy access to 383+ incident-level datasets for over 3500 police agencies. Types of data include traffic stops, use of force, officer-involved shootings, and complaints. 

Users request data by department name and type of data, and the data is returned as a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). There is no need to manually find the data online or to know how to work with open data APIs (ArcGIS, Socrata, etc.).

OpenPoliceData provides access to police data with 2 simple lines of code:
```
> import openpolicedata as opd
> src = opd.Source("New Orleans")
> data = src.load_from_url(year=2022, table_type="USE OF FORCE")
```

### Fixed
- Fixed issue when using load_from_url_gen with Socrata and Carto data where data needed to be sorted by data IDs in order to prevent loading a few repeated rows due to changing order of data on server
- Fixed error thrown when dataset has date field but that column is not returned because the rows requested are all empty
