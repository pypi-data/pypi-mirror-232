Example â„– 1
===========

This example produces *Effective Area* (Aeff), 
*Point Spread Function* (PSF), *Energy Dispersion* (Edisp) 
files in .fits format from original KM3NeT 
simulation dst.root file. And finally merge them into one common
.fits file.

# Effective Area

# To create ``.fits`` for *Effective area*, we need to pass a pandas data frame as input.
# Default name is ``aeff.fits``.

# Point Spread Function
# ---------------------
# In this part we create ``.fits`` for *Point Spread Function*.
# Default name is ``psf.fits``.

# Energy dispertion
# -----------------
# In this part we create ``.fits`` for *Energy dispertion*
# Default name is ``edisp.fits``.

# %%
# Merge into one file
# -------------------
# All ``.fits`` files can be merged in one ``.fits`` file for convenience.
# Missing background file can be taken from data folder of the package.
# Later the creation of background ``.fits`` file will be added.

# Check content with gammapy
# --------------------------
# | Here is an example how to test created `.fits` files with `gammapy <https://gammapy.org/>`_.
# | Firstly it requires to install gammapy.
# | ``!pip install gammapy``
# | ``from gammapy.irf import EffectiveAreaTable2D, PSF3D, EnergyDispersion2D``
# | ``aeff = EffectiveAreaTable2D.read("aeff.fits", hdu="EFFECTIVE AREA")``
# | ``print(aeff)``
# | Similar procedure shouldbe repeated with other ``.fits`` files.
