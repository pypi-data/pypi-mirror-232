Features
---------

- **Address Parsing**: Extract structured information from US addresses, including street names, house numbers, city, state, and ZIP codes.
- **Address Validation**: Validate US addresses to ensure accuracy and compliance with USPS standards.  
- **Address Formatting**: Format US addresses in a consistent and standardized manner for various purposes.
- **Address Geocoding**: Convert US addresses into Longitude and Latitude.
- **Additional Utilities**: Additional utilities to enhance address handling, such as address comparison, address normalization, and more.

Installation
-------------

send_the_raven can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install send-the-raven

Usage
------

Here is a quick example of using send_the_raven to validate addresses into USPS Database:

.. code-block:: python

   from send_the_raven import Validator
   
   addresses = [
      {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA", "zip_code": "12345"},
      {"street": "456 Oak Rd", "city": "Forest", "state": "VT", "zip_code": "67890"}
   ]
   
   validator = Validator(addresses, usps_id="MY_ID")
   valid_addresses = validator()
   
send_the_raven handles parsing the address data, constructing the validation requests, and returning the corrected addresses.

The :py|.`~send_the_raven.address.Address`|_ class also provides methods for normalizing, geocoding, and working with addresses.
