## About

AI is pretty cool, but a lot of fuss around it is just chatter.
This package tries to provide a toolkit to easily implement basic applications using ChatGPT, so you can get your hands dirty, and see whether you can do something useful with it.

It automatically takes care of some issues around interacting with a chatbot, like settings and session management, data persistence, communication, and gluing it together.

## Installation

```console
pip install ai-chatter
```
