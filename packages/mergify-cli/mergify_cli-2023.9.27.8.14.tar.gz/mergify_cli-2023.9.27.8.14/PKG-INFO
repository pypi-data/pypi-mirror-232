# Mergify CLI - Stacked Pull Request Automation

## Introduction

Mergify CLI is a tool that automates the creation and management of stacked pull requests on GitHub. Stacked pull requests are a way to organize and review changes that are based on a single feature branch. This tool simplifies the process of creating multiple pull requests for each commit in the feature branch, similar to how Gerrit handles code reviews.

## What are Stacked Pull Requests?

Imagine you have a branch called `feature` with three commits: `A`, `B`, and `C`, based on the `main` branch. To create stacked pull requests with this feature branch, you would traditionally have to perform the following steps:

1. Create a branch `feature-A` with only commit `A` based on `main` and create a pull request.
2. Create a branch `feature-B` with only commit `B` based on `feature-A` and create a pull request.
3. Create a branch `feature-C` with only commit `C` based on `feature-B` and create a pull request.

However, GitHub's native stacked pull request feature has some limitations. If you need to make changes to commit `A`, you would have to manually update all the branches and pull requests, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. You cannot update only the `feature-A` branch without making other branches outdated.

## The Solution: Mergify CLI

Mergify CLI solves the problem of managing stacked pull requests by automating the entire process. It utilizes a technique similar to other code review tools like Gerrit to inject a unique identifier into the commit message. This identifier is added automatically via a git commit-msg hook. Here's an example of the injected ID:

```
Change-Id: I7074fdf5e24e2d4de721936260e4b962532c9735
```

These IDs allow Mergify CLI to track and manage the changes on your `feature` branch effectively. Mergify CLI will assume that your commit messages are correctly written and will use them in the title and body of each pull requests.

Mergify CLI leverages the GitHub API to perform various tasks, keeping your local git repository clean. However, unlike Gerrit, Mergify CLI requires the branches to be in the `heads` namespace to open pull requests. Custom namespaces for hiding the git reference on the remote repository are not supported.

## Installation

You can install Mergify CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install mergify_cli
```

## Configuration

To use Mergify CLI for creating stacked pull requests in your repository, follow these steps:

1. Install the commit-msg hook by running the following command:

```bash
mergify stack --setup
```

2. Define your trunk branch, which serves as the base branch for your stacked pull requests. You can set it using the following command:

```bash
git config --add mergify-cli.stack-trunk origin/branch-name
```

Alternatively, you can set the trunk branch on the fly using the `--trunk` parameter.

```bash
mergify --trunk=origin/branch-name
```

3. Set up a GitHub OAuth token for Mergify CLI to access the GitHub API. It is recommended to do it through the [gh client](https://cli.github.com/) while you're already authenticated. In this case, Mergify CLI will automatically retrieve the token using `gh auth token`. Alternatively, you can create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with the necessary permissions to create branches and pull requests. Set the token as an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` or provide it on the fly using the `--token` parameter.

## Usage

To create a stack of pull requests, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch and make your desired changes on that branch.
2. Commit your changes. Your commit message now include the `Change-Id` automatically if you have set up Mergify CLI correctly.
3. If you committed your changes before setting up Mergify CLI, you can reword your commits using `git rebase <base-branch> -i` to include the `Change-Id` automatically.
4. Run the following command to create the stack:

```bash
mergify stack
```

Mergify CLI will automatically handle the creation of individual pull requests for each commit in your feature branch. This will allow you to use a streamlined and efficient process of managing the changes and reviews associated with each pull request of the stack.

By using Mergify CLI, you no longer need to manually update branches and pull requests when making changes to earlier commits in a stack. The tool intelligently tracks and manages the commit index or SHA, ensuring that your stacked pull requests remain up-to-date and synchronized.

Remember that one pull request will be created for each commit in your feature branch, facilitating an organized and incremental review process.

Feel free to explore additional options and parameters available with the `mergify` command to customize the behavior of Mergify CLI based on your specific needs.

That's it! With Mergify CLI, you can automate the creation and management of stacked pull requests, saving time and reducing the chances of errors during the process.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the documentation or reach out to the Mergify CLI community for support, directly in this project or on our [community Slack](https://slack.mergify.com).

Thank you for using Mergify CLI to streamline your pull request workflow!
