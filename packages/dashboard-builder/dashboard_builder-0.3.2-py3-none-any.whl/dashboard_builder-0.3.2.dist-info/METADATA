*About*: Inspired by Shiny and Streamlit, this is currently a flask focused python library to help assist with fast dashboarding. While Streamlit and Shiny are highly opinioned, this approach brings the dashboarding functionality (limited right now) to your flask environment, allowing you the freedom to further create and curate the application as you please. In the future, I imagine create a version that is also capable of being embedded into a Django or FastAPI web framework. 

**Key Features**: 

- *Input Elements*: 
    - Single select 
    - Radio button 
    - Slider
    - Free text
    
- *Output Elements*: 
    - Visualizations
        - Altair 
        - Matplotlib 
    - Markdown 
    - Free text 

- *Container Related Elements*:
    - Column 
    - Expander 

- Default and custom templates 
    - Currently have two default templates to choose between for a dashboard page: 
        - `base`: contains a side-bar (on left hand side for placing interactive widgets) and a main output view
        - `base_nosidebar`: contains a main output view only, no side bar; helpful for view-only dashboards with no need to interactivity
    - Custom Templates 
        - You can create your own custom template and load it in. Generally speaking, you can make the template look however you want. 
        - The default base template that we use, that you can modify however you want is [found here](https://github.com/hantswilliams/dashboard-builder/blob/main/dashboard_builder/dashboard_templates/base.j2)
        - You can then then set the custom folder where the template exists with the `dashboard_builder.config` parameter, and then call the `get_dashboard_template_custom` function to use your own template!  


**Example dashboards**: 

1. Complex example of Hospital and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Data for Long Island, New York. It is deployed via Vercel, [please click here](https://dashboard-builder-nyhospitals.appliedhealthinformatics.com). The associated github source code for this repo can found here [https://github.com/hantswilliams/dashboard-builder-cms-longisland](https://github.com/hantswilliams/dashboard-builder-cms-longisland).

## Component Manager

The heart of the flask dashboarding library lies in the `ComponentManager`. It serves as a central coordinator for managing both input and output components, ensuring that everything is orchestrated in a seamless manner. Let's dive deeper:

### Role of the Component Manager:

1. **Managing State**: The `ComponentManager` retains the state of all registered components. This allows for the preservation of user inputs, even between page refreshes, enhancing the user experience.

2. **Input Handling**: Every input, whether it be a dropdown, textbox, or a slider, is registered and managed by the `ComponentManager`. This registration aids in the collection of user input data, making it straightforward to access and process.

3. **Output Rendering**: After processing the data, you can register output components that dictate how the processed data should be displayed. Whether you want to show a graph, a table, or just some text, the `ComponentManager` can handle it. It ensures that the outputs are rendered in the order they're registered.

4. **HTML Integration**: Instead of manually curating HTML templates, the `ComponentManager` integrates with pre-defined templates. The registered input and output components are automatically injected into these templates, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive UI experience.

### How to Use the Component Manager:

It's quite simple. At the beginning of your endpoint function:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the `ComponentManager` with the current request.

    ```python
    manager = ComponentManager(request)
    ```

2. **Input Registration**: Create your inputs, encapsulate them into `FormGroups` if necessary, and then register these inputs with the manager.

    ```python
    input2_dropdown = InputDropdown(name='hospital_selection', label='Select a hospital:', values=(df, 'Hospital Name'))
    manager.register_input(input2_dropdown)
    ```

3. **Output Registration**: After processing your data, decide how you want to display it. Create output components and register them with the manager.

    ```python
    manager.register_output(OutputText(f"The median net income is {avg_net_income}."))
    ```

4. **Rendering**: Finally, use the manager's rendering methods to get the HTML representation of the components and inject them into your chosen template.

    ```python
    return render_template_string(
        get_template('base.html'),
        form_groups=manager.render_form_groups(), 
        output_components=manager.render_outputs()
    )
    ```

By using the `ComponentManager`, you can ensure a structured and streamlined approach to dashboarding, all while retaining the flexibility and customizability that Flask offers.

# Installation and Walk-through

## Installation 

### Pip
```bash
pip install dashboard-builder
```

### Poetry
```bash
poetry add dashboard-builder
```

## How to: 

1. **LOAD LIBRARY**: First load in the library at the top of you app file. In a basic example, it might look like this:
```python
from flask_dashboard import get_dashboard_template
from flask_dashboard.components.inputs import InputDropdown
from flask_dashboard.components.outputs import OutputText, OutputChart_Matplotlib, OutputTable_HTML, OutputImage, OutputMarkdown
from flask_dashboard.components.managers import ComponentManager, FormGroup
```

2. **INPUT SECTION**: Create a `FormGroup`. The idea here is that you might want to have multiple sets of filters, that are nested together within a form, all within a single page. If you are familiar with HTML, think about having multiple forms on a single HTML page. In order to achieve this, we have the concept of a `FormGroup`, that can be composed of multiple inputs. In the below example, we are creating a form group with a single input field:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():

    # Step 1: Initialize the component manager for this request/endpoint
    manager = ComponentManager(request)

    # Step 2: Registering and capturing inputs for this request
    # We can separate these into distinct groups, so here is the first group: 
    hospital_form_group = FormGroup(action_url='/')
    input2_dropdown = InputDropdown(name='hospital_selection', label='Select a hospital:', values=(df, 'Hospital Name'))
    hospital_form_group.add_input(input2_dropdown)
    manager.register_input(input2_dropdown)
    manager.register_form_group(hospital_form_group)
```

3. **SERVER SECTION**: Based on the form input, we then do some *normal* python coding, based on the received inputs from the form(s). The rest of thie code is from `test_data_processing.py` file if you want to see what manipulations are happening:

```python
    output_df, avg_net_income, diff_net_income, plt = process_data(df, [input2_dropdown.value, 
                                                                        input2_dropdown2.value, input2_dropdown3.value])
```

4. **OUTPUT SECTION**: In a attempt to again reduce, or completely remove the need to do any HTML/CSS/Javascript, we have wrapped up specific types of *output components* so you do not need to worry about rendering or dealing with HTML. This is heavily inspired by what I see in Streamlit:

In the below example, you register specific output components, like `OutputMark` or `OutputTable_HTML`, based on what you then want to present to the user on that specific page (endpoint). 

```python
    manager.register_output(OutputImage("https://www.stonybrook.edu/far-beyond/img/branding/logo/sbu/primary/300/stony-brook-university-logo-horizontal-300.png"))
    manager.register_output(OutputText(f"The median net income across these {len(df)} hospitals is {avg_net_income}."))
    manager.register_output(OutputText(f"The difference between the selected hospital ({input2_dropdown.value.lower()}) and the median net income across these {len(df)} hospitals is {diff_net_income}."))
    manager.register_output(OutputMarkdown("""---"""))
    manager.register_output(OutputChart_Matplotlib(plt))
    manager.register_output(OutputMarkdown("""### Hospital Financial Detail Data"""))
    manager.register_output(OutputTable_HTML(output_df.to_dict(orient='records')))
    manager.register_output(OutputMarkdown("""<br /> <br /> """))
```

Finally, after this step, you then being together all of the inputs and outputs, and select a specific template. Right now in the module, there is only a `base.html`` template, but in the future, I will add in more that the user can choose between. 

```python
    return render_template_string(
        get_dashboard_template('base'),
        form_groups=manager.render_form_groups(), 
        output_components=manager.render_outputs()
    )
```

## Stable features for Input 

Currently there are three inputs that I have tested more thoroughly then others: 

1. Dropdown (single select): `flask_dashboard.components.inputs.InputDropdown`
2. Slider (categorical): `flask_dashboard.components.inputs.InputSlider_Categorical`
3. Radio button: `flask_dashboard.components.inputs.InputRadio`

For each of these features, there is a default 'Select All'. So when you add in your selections either as a list or tuple, the input module will automatically add in a `Select All` so there is no need for you to do that. Part of the logic being this, is since we have multiple forms, and we want to have default values, the select all is a pretty good option to keep the logic very simple. By default, whether it is a slide, dropdown, or radio button, the default value will be select all. This way if a section is not 'activated', e.g., you didn't click it, the logic/form will default to not filtering anything from that form section.

## Generating charts with MatplotLib 

Currently, utilizing MatplotLib - Figure (not plot) to generate the images. Plt suffers from memory leaks. Need to work on stylization of `Figure`. For a detailed summary of why we can not use matplotlib plot, please [review here](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/user_interfaces/web_application_server_sgskip.html). 


## Local Dev Notes

### Pytest 

Pytest is installed as a local dev. Current test are found within `/tests`. Need to continue building out, but for now there are a few. 

To run the pytests, inside the root directory can run the following:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Poetry and Deployment 

I'm new to poetry so putting this information here so I dont forgot. Using 
poetry for managing dependencies and deploying. On my local machine 
also using pyenv for python version controll manager. So start up the remote 
environment, can do the following below from [this blog post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-and-publish-python-packages-with-poetry/):

1. Set the python version - currently 3.10 for this project: `pyenv global 3.10.0`

2. Tell poetry to use that: `poetry env use $(pyenv which python)`. 

3. This should then pick up the correct version of python. You can then confirm 
this by doing `poetry env info`, and you should then see something like 
below:

```bash
Virtualenv
Python:         3.10.0
Implementation: CPython
Path:           
/Users/hantswilliams/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/dashboard-builder-HW6rzWnP-py3.10
Executable:     
/Users/hantswilliams/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/dashboard-builder-HW6rzWnP-py3.10/bin/python
Valid:          True

System
Platform:   darwin
OS:         posix
Python:     3.10.0
Path:       /Users/hantswilliams/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0
Executable: /Users/hantswilliams/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/bin/python3.10
``` 

4. To get a list of the poetry env created, can use: `poetry env list` 

5. Then can add things, e.g., `poetry add requests` 

Once done there, can then generate the requirements.txt file with:

```bash
poetry export --output requirements.txt
```

For publishing: 
1. Package the updates: 

```bash 
poetry build

``` 
2. Once it has finished packing, can run below to get the latest version on pypi: 

```bash
poetry publish
``` 

3. For subsequent builds, need to update the version number first in the .toml file, otherwise the build will fail. Once .toml version is updated, can even do the build/publish in the same command like so:

```bash
poetry published --build
```
