The Berndt lab developed a cloud-based software called FUSE, designed to label and analyze fluorescent cells in time-series microscopy images. FUSE utilizes the Cellpose cell segmentation algorithm and a novel specialized cell labeling algorithm developed by the Berndt lab. With a user-friendly interface through Google Colab, FUSE allows users to efficiently analyze their data, providing a convenient, free, and fast method for analyzing timecourse data.

## Motivations
- Population analysis-based platform for fluorescence data
- Generates easy-to-use platform 
- Aligns methods used to analyze fluorescent data
- Novel frame-by-frame cell identification algorithm that can be used with Cellpose segmentation 
- Open source + Free platform
- Mitigating experimental burden associated with hand-drawn segmentation
- Cloud based storage and handling of data attenuates issues with data management and storage

## Features
- Cloud-based implementation using Google Colab
- User-friendly interface with Google Colab forms
- Customizable pipeline for advanced users
- Integration with Cellpose for automated segmentation
- Convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction
- Analysis of fluorescence readouts (delta f) over time

## Prerequisites
- Google Account for accessing Google Colab
- Cellpose-generated segmentation masks
- Fluorescence microscopy videos in TIF format

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the FUSE repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the repository to your Google Drive.
3. Open the main FUSE notebook in Google Colab.
4. Set up the Google Colab environment with the required dependencies.

## Customization
Advanced users can modify the underlying code to better suit their specific cell types or experiment requirements. Customization options include adjusting the convolutional autoencoder parameters and modifying the tracking algorithm.

## Results and Output
FUSE outputs the delta f (change in fluorescence) of the tracked cells over time, providing valuable insights into cell signaling events.
