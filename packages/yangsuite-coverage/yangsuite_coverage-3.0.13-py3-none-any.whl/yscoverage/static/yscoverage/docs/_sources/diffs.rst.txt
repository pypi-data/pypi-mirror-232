YANG Diffs
==========

Making use of the dataset functionality, you can also produce dataset that will
show you changes of a module between versions. To do this, you will need 2 YANG
sets, one containing the module with the newer version and one containing the
same module with the older version. Do the same dataset setup used to output a
dataset, but then also choose the "Previous YANG Set for comparison" to instead
output the differences between them.

Just like the datasets "Display diff" shows in the web page or "Download .csv"
to download a results file to the browser.

- greater than less than (< and >) represent differences between an xpath

- minus (-) shows an xpath that has been removed

- plus (+) shows an xpath that has been added
