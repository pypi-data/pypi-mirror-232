    "A `CompositionSystem` is, abstractly, a collection of ways of doing composition on some kind of object language elements via a mapping of those to metalanguage elements. This mapping is, again abstractly, managed by objects that implement the `Composable` interface. So, given some sequence of compatible `Composable`s, a `CompositionSystem` will search for ways of putting them together to produce a new `Composable` that aggregates any possible compositions of elements in the sequence. For most purposes, you will work with the active composition system set at the package-level, accessed via `lamb.lang.get_system` and `lamb.lang.set_system`.\n",

Objects of this class map a single string to a single metalanguage element. Items are exactly the class instantiated using the `%%lamb` magic with `||...|||`:"

In general, what sort of object you get back depends on the composition system, but for the default one, the result will be a `CompositionResult` object. This object represents a stage of composition, and can hold multiple composition paths. Each path is itself represented as a `Composable`. To access these, you can index the result object directly, and like `Item`, the objects used internally implement `name` and `content`. For this composition system, the name of composition results is determined by the operation and the parts, so therefore the name may vary depending on how composition proceeded and `CompositionResult` itself does not implement `name`.

As usual, a `TreeComposite` object allows access to the result of composition via `name` and `content`, and implements `show()` and `tree()`. The value of `content` will be a metalanguage expression (or `None` in special cases). The value of `name` is programmatically constructed from the names of the parts and cannot be set.

This kind of composition system, implemented as a `lamb.lang.TreeCompositionSystem`, is more complicated, and somewhat richer than pure bottom-up composition.

    "One caveat is that the semantics of `compose` are different for `CompositionTree` objects: calling `compose` with a `CompositionTree` as the only argument will try to compose that tree in place. Therefore, if you want to force unary composition (e.g. the NN rule), you cannot use the `* None` shorthand, or regular `compose` calls. If you want to do this, you can use the `unary_extend` function (which is a shorthand for calling a class-specific `compose` with `unary_extend=True`). Unary composition in general needs to be thought of a bit differently when using this composition system. (In the following example, `gray` is automatically converted as above before the unary composition step is applied.)"

    "A composition operation, at a high level, takes 1 or more `Composable`s (i.e. mappings from object-language to metalanguage elements) and manipulates them in some form to produce a new `Composable`. They are implemented as callable objects, in order to better track and display information, but these objects are just thing wrappers over a function that does the work. There are basically two kinds of composition operatinos:\n",
    "\n",
    "* those that can be entirely represented in the metalanguage.\n",
    "* those that require manipulation of the object language.\n",

There are two built-in abstract classes for dealing with composition, corresponding to the two kinds of composition: `CompositionOp` and `TreeCompositionOp`.\n",

    "### 4.1. Composition operation objects for bottom-up composition\n",

    "There are several levels of abstraction for building composition operations. The most complicated is to work with composition operation objects directly, but when the composition operation can be directly expressed as a metalanguage combinator, it is usually simplest to use one of several available factory functions. I begin with the most complicated case and progress to the simpler ones. \n",

    "#### Working with `CompositionOp` objects directly\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CompositionOp` class itself is best thought of as abstract; in practice, bottom-op operations can either be unary (`UnaryCompositionOp`) or binary (`BinaryCompositionOp`), depending on how many arguments they take. (In principle, n-ary operations are possible but none are implemented.) In addition to a name and a function providing the actual operation, both types take the following optional parameters:\n",
    "* `allow_none=False`: if set to `False`, tells the operation to cause a `CompositionFailure` on arguments whose content is `None`. This is set to `True` for composition operations that act entirely on object language information, i.e. purely syncategorematic rules.\n",
    "* `reduce=True`: whether to automatically trigger reduction. (Generally, if this is `False`, the implementation should do it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A unary operation can also take:\n",
    "* `typeshift=False`: if set to `True`, flags the operation as a type-shift. This is basically cosmetic on the operation itself, but affects how the operation is interpreted by a composition system that it is used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary operation can also take:\n",
    "* `commutative=False`: if set to `True`, tells the composition system to not bother to try both orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "By way of example, the following cell illustrates a trivial unary composition operation that just returns its argument. The `trivial` function takes a single argument, which will be a `SingletonComposable` of some kind (you can assume that `content` is available and will be a single metalanguage object, or `None` if allowed). This kind of function must also allow an optional `assignment` named parameter and is responsible for passing along the assignment (which can of course be manipulated). The function returns another `Composable`; for normal cases, `UnaryComposite` and `BinaryComposite` are useful wrapper classes to use."

    "You can see that when working with `CompositionOp` objects directly, there is a lot of potential for what manipulations are possible (the examples don't even scratch the surface), but also a lot of scaffolding to remember and deal with. As long as a composition operation doesn't interact with any of the object language representation or with the assignment, or have some special needs in terms of error conditions, it can often be expressed purely as a metalanguage combinator (a function with no free variables). To handle this, there are several factory functions for generating `CompositionOp` objects from such combinators (or python functions that operate on metalanguage objects), as well as for adding combinator-based operations directly to a composition system. I will demonstrate each of these in turn, re-implementing the above examples.\n",

These factory functions take functions that operate on metalanguage objects, rather than object-metalanguage mappings, and take care of the extra infrastructure that would be involved in the mapping. As indicated by the names, `binary_factory` expects a curried function, and as such, is appropriate for use with a metalanguage object. The factory functions take the same parameters that the two `CompositionOp` subclasses do.\n",

To enable type-shifting, you will need to designate some unary operation(s) as typeshifts (when creating the operation, or by setting the `typeshift` property to `True`), and enable type-shifting on the composition operations (set property `typeshift` on the composition system object to `True`). The other parameter that impacts this is `typeshift_depth` on the composition system, which provides a hard cap for how much type-shifting the system will try before giving up -- since this is exhaustive search."
