            Templating is supported for uris, split names, and filter expessions for scheduled
            ingestion.  The scheduler passes in several variables and functions when evaluating the
            supported field, which can be accessed by using the syntax: ${<field>}.

            For example, to add the run date to the split name you can add the following suffix when
            submitting a split name to scheduled ingestion: "split_name_${formatDate("yyyy-MM-dd", now)}"

            Supported variables:
                - now: The Date of the run.
                - last: The Date of the last run.
                - lastSuccess: The Date of the last successful run.

            Supported functions:
                - uuid(): Generate a random v4 uuid.
                - formatDate(<format>, <date>): Format the given Date as a string.  Format follows
                    Java SimpleDateFormat (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).
                - epochMillis(<date>): The epoch millis of the given Date.

        Args:
            raw_json (str): The JSON string representation of the request tree.  To build a json
                string, you can use the serialize_split function.
            cron_schedule (str): The schedule for the periodic ingestion.  Follows cron unix format:
                ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
                │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
                │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
                │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
                │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
                │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)

                │ │ │ │ │
                * * * * *

                For example, to run a cron on the first of every month: "0 0 1 * *"
