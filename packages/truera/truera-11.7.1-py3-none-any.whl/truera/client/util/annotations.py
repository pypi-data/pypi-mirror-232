# Utilities for dealing with __future__.annotations

- Owners: piotrm

Some part of these utilities are for consistently dealing with method
annotations under __future__.annotation and without it. You will find `TypeLike`
to signify something which already is a type or a string which needs to be
evaluated to retrieve the named type.

The benefit of __future__.annotations, however, is that we can type more things
that might not otherwise be typable. Additionally, the same handling we need for
this feature are also useful for referring to types that come from optionally
installed packages without producing errors when they are not installed.
