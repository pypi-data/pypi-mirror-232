# Function overloading

Owners: piotrm

This file contains an implementation of function overloading that has some
features that the standard `overload` module does not.

# Caveats

The overloading scheme relies on type annotations and on those annotations to
support isinstance/issubclass. Because of this, you cannot use most of the type
aliases in `typing.*` as they are not actual types. Some of the more useful type
constructors like `Union` implemented as types are in `types.py` but you should
use them only if you need the type checking functionality like overload does.
