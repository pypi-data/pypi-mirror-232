### INTRODUCTION

convertpngs is a module to help you to do some image processing work. It is based on the opencv-python module and Pillow module, convert the multiple png files to form of gif or mp4. It is a module that CYC wrote for his own use, but I think it is useful for others, so I published it.

### IMPORTANT

If you encounter the ModuleNotFoundError when using this module, you need to manually install the module in the lastest version:
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install Pillow`

Also, some modules do not support the previous version of python, make sure you are using the version 3.7 or above.
