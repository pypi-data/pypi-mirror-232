  Legal Aid of West Virginia (LAWV) provides free legal services through grants 
  and the support of the public. LAWV funders, the media and the public often 
  want to know the impact this has in our communities. One of the best ways to 
  demonstrate this impact is through personal stories!

  While occasionally sharing personal stories helps further LAWV's mission, LAWV 
  cannot share your story without your permission. The choice is yours, and you're 
  free to keep information about your case confidential. If you decide to share your 
  story, LAWV's communications team will work with you to hear and tell the important 
  parts of that story.
