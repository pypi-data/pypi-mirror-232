webssh_embedded
-----------------

This release is simplified compared to the previous versions. No database connection is made. Instead a REST call is made to a server dealing with the database. This represents a standard Microservice architecture where webssh_embedded takes care of only the SSH connections and not the database. A separate database service would take care of the CRUD ops. Hence the implementation of such a service and also the database is completely left to the developer. Also this release removes the pending command handling feature. The logging has been improved. A separate logs directory will be created. One log per terminal session will be created in the logs directory. The frontend has also been simplified and only demonstrates the command execution feature. The frontend implementation is completely left to the developer.
