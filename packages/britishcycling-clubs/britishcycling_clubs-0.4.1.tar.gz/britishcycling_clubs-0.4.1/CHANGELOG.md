### Fixed

- Reliability issues when getting data from Club Manager pages with
 `get_private_member_counts()`. See 'Changed'

- Use of `assert` in production code

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Simplify package structure.
 
  `import britishcycling-clubs.main` should be replaced with `import 
  britishcycling-clubs`

- Use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) instead of Selenium when getting 
  data from Club Manager pages with `get_private_member_counts()`

  This makes deployment easier, as Playwright simplifies browser installation and
  updates, and a separate driver executable is no longer required. README updated to 
  cover this

  types-beautifulsoup4
