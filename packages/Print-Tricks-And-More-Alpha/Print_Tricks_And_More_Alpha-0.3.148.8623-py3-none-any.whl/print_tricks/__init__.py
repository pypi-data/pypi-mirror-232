    ### - Import by placing the following line with your other import statements:
    ###   from print_tricks import pt

    ### - read through the variables below: "ReadMe_Quick" & "ReadMe_Detailed",
    ### or type "pt.pt()" in your terminal to read these in a nicer formatted style.

    Quick Summary:

        Print tricks design principles, strength of features, and goals: 
        
        To make complicated, multi-line programming to become more effective and as simple as possible for the developer to use. For example: How can we simultaneously make the print() statement easier/faster to type while also enhancing all of it's functionality? Instead of just printing the value of a variable with no context as to where this random value will show up, pt() will actually display the statement that called the variable, it's value, it's type, length, the file it's located in, the function it's inside of, it's line number, and it's bytesize, etc. This _information is formatted for consistency and includes colors for finding the relavant details faster. As a further improvement, you can type in blank "pt()" statements to very quickly and easily use these statements to debug your app. You can type any number and types of variables into the same pt() statement, and it will auto format them all for you and give you all of the same relevant _information. 

        For example: if my_var = 123, then typing in "pt(my_var)" will output: "pt(my_var): 123 - int, Length: 3, (Line :75, #myFunction, my_file.py)"

        All other Print Tricks functions are the same: They take multi-line programming techniques, and compile them into a very quick and easy to type statement. For all of the major pt   functions, you simply add a letter to quickly use that ability. 

    To Import Into Your Project:
        "from print_tricks import pt"

    Marketing (pypi, github, intro paragraphs, etc):

        - Do you want your print statements to be easier to write and give you far more
            information? 
        - Or do you want the power of logging with the simplicity of a simple print 
            line?
        - And when you are done building your program and are ready for professional
        production, your print statements can automatically convert to the equivalent
        of the logging module for professional ready code!!!

    Functions in Print Tricks Class:

        pt()          = Printing replacement - Examples:
                        =>  my_var = 123
                        =>  pt(my_var)              = pt(my_var): 123 - int, Length: 3, (Line :75, #myFunction, my_file.py)
                        =>  pt(my_var, 'my_string')  = my_string - pt(my_var, 'my_string'): 123 - int, Length: 3, (Line :75, #myFunction, my_file.py)
        pt.e()        = Exceptions  (place in try/except blocks)
        pt.h()        = Thread ID Number + Multi-Threading
        pt.hr()       = Multi-Threading with return values
        pt.l()        = Location    (get/set)
        pt.p()        = Pause   (wait for keyboard input)
        pt.t()        = Timer   (Advanced, self-accounting, easy to use timer, with automatic tracking of individually named statements)
        pt.w()        = Wait    (time.sleep tracker)
        pt.disable()  = Disable functions
        pt.enable()   = Enable functions
        pt.delete()   = delete/rename/edit/change any text located in any file.

        pt.tut()      = Tutorial, page by page.

    Functions being worked on:
        -   pt.c        = User Text colors in terminal. Just color, nothing else.
        -   pt.ci       = send colored string to pt() to have a simple string with all details of regular pt() function but in specified color
        -   pt.?        = Current Status (of variables)
        -   pt.f        = Find
        -   pt.x        = Gen data

    #### Function Details: ####

    pt()        = Main fast print
                    - You simply type out pt() and it runs the __init__ which prints a nice print statement, faster than traditional print() and with much more _information. 
                        - Features:
                            - colors for easier identification
                            - Variable name, in string that is easy to search for
                            - Variable Value (but with colors for identification)
                            - Type of the variable
                            - Length of the variable (whether this type supports a length by default or not, a real length will be printed)
                            - Line Number of this print statement
                            - Originating Function Name 
                            - Originating File
                            - Enable/Disable any/all statements with a simple pt.disable/pt.enable command. 
                                Example: pt.disable(p)
                                    This will disable all pt.p (pause) statements within your code. 
                            - Eliminates the hangup of the traditional Python print() statement for large vars
                                (normally, if you try to print a 300mb list of like 2000 random floats, it could take 30 seconds for the print() function to 
                                reduce the size and then print the var, but my pt() statement reduces this early, saves the processing time, and still arrives within
                                a 99.8 percent accuracy on the size)
                            - Prints the actual size in Bytes of the object automatically if it is larger than ~ 800 bytes (or you can use pt.size() to get the bytesize of any variable)

    pt.delete() = Delete
            delete all print statements 
            - Takes arguments:
                - The statements to delete
                - file: (optional) What file to search inside of, defaults to current file. 
                - Replacement (optional) Replacement text. (defaults to blank... which just means delete of course)
                - Range to search through (optional). List a range of the line numbers of the file to delete things on. 
            - Example:
                - pt.delete("fileLocation.file.py", "pt.t(a)")
                    - pt.delete function will start the delete function, it'll search through file.py, and look for functions that look like "pt.t(a)"...

    pt.e()      = Exceptions
                    - Place into the except statement in a try/catch block. 
                    - Compact, easy to use. Allows you to have the running stability of a Try/Except statement while still retaining the Exception _information that would have caused an error. 
                    - Features:
                        - Clickable Links to line Number, File, Function name (If your terminal supports clickable links)
                        - Line that caused the error
                        - Error Message
                        - Line Number
                        - Function Name
                        - File Path
                        - File Name
                        - Traceback
                        - Custom String
                    - Example:
                        Try:
                            print(len(int))
                        Except:
                            pt.e()

                    - (This will print:)
                        pt.e___Exception: TypeError: object of type 'type' has no len()
                        Error at: print(len(int)) - (Line :1395, #exceptionsFunctionTest, \print_tricks.py)

    pt.h()      = Threading ID #
                    - Displays the Thread # for this
                    - Maybe displays the number of unique threads that have been recorded this session, thus far. "Total # of unique threads"

    pt.l()      = Location
                    Examples:
                        pt.l() ## Returns 2 items: location of current file, and current folder path. 
                        pt.l('nameOfFile.py') ## Returns 3 items, now includes the current location plus whatever file_path we specified. 
                        locations = pt.l()
                        folder_Location = locations[2]
                    Features:
                        - Returns 
                            - The location of any new files that you'd like to create
                            - The location of the current file that is calling the function.
                            - The location of the directory only (no files)
                        Optionally:
                            - Prints all of these, formatted nicely if the command is like this:
                                - "pt.l(print_this=True)" or "pt.l('newFile.py', print_this=True)"
    pt.p()      = Pause
                    - Pauses until a key is pressed
                        - Any key can be pressed, unless you specify the key. 
                    - Loops (optional) - can specify how many times this pause function should be triggered until is actually pauses the app. 
                    - Continue (optional) - Continue after only 1 pause
                        TODO - Adjust this so you can specify how many times to pause before continuing on forever. 
                    - Slow Mo - (WIP) include an optional "slow motion mode" that specifies how much slower you want the code to run
                        (may need to put this into a wrapper to make slow mo happen?)
                    - Useful tip NOTE: perfect for debugging code. 
    pt.t()      = Timer
                    Shows time between pt.t statements
                    Features:
                        - quickly type in small statements with the same identifier, and it will automatically tell you the time between them. Example: pt.t('a')
                            - If you have more than one a, it'll print out the differences in time between the last two only. 
                            - An optional argument called 'multipleTimers' will make your function so that it adds up the time between all 'a' statements. So it'll have a1 to a2, and a1  to a3, and also a2 to a3 etc... So like all of the times recorded between various orientations, up to that point in your code. 
                        - ~9,000 times more precise than using time.time()
                            - time.time() = .016 seconds precision
                            - pt.t()      = .000001 seconds precision
                            - pt.precise  = .0000004 seconds precision
                        - Automatically disregards almost all of it's own running time (within e-07 or .0000001 accuracy)
    pt.precise  = Precision timer
                    - Slightly more accurate than pt.t() by only .0000004 seconds precision. Simply returns perf_counter. 
                    - Must be used by assigning it a variable and then checking that variable. Does not include all of the extra's that pt.t() provides. 
    pt.w()      = Wait
                    - It's an enhanced version of time.sleep(), but if no argument, do a default of 0.05. 
                    - It prints out the time slept
                    - It accepts ints or floats, and converts to string only for the printing part of it. 
                    - Supports these arguments:
                        - Time to sleep for just this one
                        - Tag (can mark several of these with the same tag. If marked with the same tag, their default timing and print statements will match the set timing and print statements of the first tag in the series (or at least the first tag that was set), or the last tag that was changed)
                        - str_fronts 

    pt.disable()= disable functions
                    - Disables each type of function from printing
    pt.enable() = enable functions
                    - re-enables whatever functions have already been disabled

    """
TODO_FINAL_PREP = """
    These are all ideas that I can possibly do to help setup for more serious 
    ventures (directly or indirectly):
    
    - Library: file_decorator (pypi):
        - Advertise library as a file decorator / entire app decorator 

    - pypi upload script: Add automatic readme. 

    - Library: pypi auto-upload projects
        - Does what my main.py does for print_tricks but does it for any app. 
        - Add ability to auto-generate readme's and upload to pypi as well. 
        
    - Script: cut-up_pt_to_individual_libraries
        - Auto-take all functions in pt, and follow their use of other functions, then
        - copy their code into their own folder/file structure
        - run the auto-upload- projects script on it to automatically upload all of those
        cut up versions to pypi. 
        

    - pt.debug:
        - Take my current settrace() code and apply it to printing out line numbers on 
        every line, function call, function return, etc. 
        - If it finds a log file stating there was a crash on a certain line, it 
        finds the line and prints all vars (global and local), just before that line is hit. 
        
    - pt.profiler:
        - Time the seconds in between everything. 
        - If its a repeated line, 
            - if was just printed: 
                - Ignore it (error between multiple events getting the vars/lines)
            - else: wasn't just printed: 
                - mark it as repeated, accumulate its time, 
            
        - optional "time to run before giving new options:"
            - After set seconds, cmd will ask you:
                - if you want to print the accumulated
                    time for everythying since the start of everything, 
                - Where to print (terminal, file)
                - To exit, or keep running. 
                - How long to keep running before another cmd prompt (0=never).

    - Focus:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
        1st - Focus on easiness. Taking hard things and tedious tasks and making them
            incredibly convenient and easy. 
        2nd - Focus on functionalities (power to do awesome things).
        3rd - Focus on writing good code, hopefully short and efficient.
        4th - Single File: Try as much as I can being integrated into just this single
            .py file. Meaning all or almost all imports are python-built ins. Everything
            else is integrated into this one file). However, this IS NOT NECESSARY. It's
            okay to require imports to make things work right!!! I can always integrate 
            later or make the imports optional. 
        5th - Stop caring about the size of this project, it's okay to be hundreds
            of KB. When I have the time, sometimes, consider reducing file size / 
            optimizations in that regard. 

    - Core1k colored text for Ursina:
        - Make my C colors compatible with ursina's Text() class for text that shows up
        on the screen. 
        
    - pt.counter():
        - all it does is print out an incremental number every time it is reached. 
    - pt.counter_fast():
        - prints the same incremental number, without all of the print_tricks extras. 
        
    - pt.every / pt.after:
        - similar to r, but trying to be more simple this time. 
        - They get simpler traceback info, use that to create a dict, check the dict 
        each time this is ran, then check for either the loops or the seconds to know
        if it should run or not. 
        - Should have a shortcut for a speed improvement:
            - If len of the pt.every or pt.after dict is only 1, then we know there is
            only 1 of these running and we can skip the traceback. 
    
    - pt.easy_testing -     
        - Add the same functionality that pt.easy_imports has for handling the target path that you want. 
            - We add "target_path_ as second parameter. Then instead of changing the sys.argv[0] to 
            os.getcwd, we instead change it to the target, that we have searched for with the
            same code found in pt.easy_imports. 
                - Whatever repeatable code we have in easy_imports should be pulled out so
                both functions can use it effectively. 
                
    - Improve speed of importing print_tricks. 
        - I tested it on gaming pc, and had a 58ms time
            - How to test: 
                from print_tricks import pt
                pt.t()
                pt.t()
                from_print_tricks import pt
                pt.t()
        - To solve: 
            - run ... ###db.t() statements in between every class, because the classes stuff is loading
            - isolate each class section that takes a while
            - Alternatively, wait for pt.profiler to be finished and just test the whole thing. 
            
    - sys._getframe()
        - Faster tracebacks right off the bat. 
            - 75x faster than traceback.extract stack. 
                - See my examples under UTI._speed_test_for_traceback, 
                    in the function time_sys_getframe()
            - possibly optimize the rest of the simpletrace functions
                as well, maybe put the whole setup in its own class so that
                I can really optimize into smaller functions. 
            - This gets everything that I want:
                "
                frame = sys._getframe().f_back.f_back.f_back.f_back.f_back.f_back
                current_file = frame.f_code.co_filename
                line_number = frame.f_lineno
                func_name = frame.f_code.co_name
                code = linecache.getline(current_file, line_number).strip()
                "
            - Then the rest of the code is basically code processing and
                and then formatting the results. So I can highly optimize it. 
        - BEFORE i DO THE REFACTORING: Get my settrace profiler to work so I can find
            out the speed of simpletrace before sys._getframe and before the re-writing
            / optimizations of it.
                
    - FUNCTION REFACTORING -
        - We take each function, function by function, part by part, 
        and refactor it into lots and lots of smaller functions. 
        - Some of which will end up in their own classes that we access. 
        - def info() could be divided into probably 15-20 other functions
        in total. And it's already a part of pt __init__. 
    
    - OOP REFACTORING -
        - Take each function, step by step, and build it into a OOP
        version of the same code. I can take my time on this. Figure out the
        best oop approach for the whole module, as well as each individual function. 
    
        
    - pt.props:
        - var values:
            - re-enable the ability to find var values (not just the default parameter values that I have right now), 
                - Check for either the value type and either:
                    - if it's a normal type (float, int), then print that default value
                    - or... just print off the first 70 or so characters regardless of what type it is. 
                - Look for old commits probably between 07/08/2023 and 08/15/2023 or thereabouts in print_tricks.py
        - Get instances to work: 
            - Currently pt.props(Entity) will work, but pt.props(e) will not (assuming e=Entity())
            - However passing in pt.props(e.__class__) will work but not sure if it's gettting the default class variables or the changed vars of e(). 
                - So check and if passed_obj doesn't have a "__name__" than that means we are passing in an instance, or perhaps not even passing in a class, so handle it via either the e.__class__ thing or something else. 
        
        - RELATED: pt(e.scale) will work but pt(Entity.scale) will return a "<property object>"
            - pt(class.property) should work even if it's not a insstance of a class. look into this. 
        
    - pt.profiler
        - My test file is currently located in I:\.PythonProjects\PrintTricks\z_pt_tests\pt_profiler_test.py
            - "pt_profiler_test.py"
        - goes to profiler class.
        - an import statement at the beginning of someone's code will immediately open up 
        mine, which will copy their code.
        - it inserts pt.t statements in between every single line, and records the original 
        line that code was on.
            And the pt.t statement name is the originating line of code that it's 
            targeting probably.
        - At very end, either:
            - my copied code inserts a pt.ex() statement to ensure that their original 
            file never runs.
            - it modified the code just with the AST so it doesn't ever really affect 
            their file anyways... so don't have to do anything.

    - To get profiler method above to work:
        - I need to not print out the timings while running (or at least have that 
        optional)
        - I need to accumulate each occurrence of the same line/statement so I can add 
        them up at the end and add the number of times that line ran.
    
    - pt.debug_all()
        - Same type of situation as the profiler:
            - places pt().debug either in between every other line, or literally on every
            single line via the ";" semi colon. The purpose in either case is to find out
            exactly where we crash.

    - pt.run()
        - You type in the location to run, or the file to run, and it finds it and runs
            - ex:
                - pt.run('main.py')
                - pt.run('..\overlay.py')
        - prints where it is trying to run with try statement, regardless of
        success or failure. 
    - pt.imports / pt.use()
        - works just like pt.l/pt.run:
        - gets the absolute location of a file for the import. 
            - "From pt.use('..') import kvt"
        - Possibly: type in just the file name and it'll search for it
            searches through the current folder, then parent folder, then sub
            directories of parent folder. 
            - import pt.use('kvt')
        - prints where it is trying to import with try statement, prints
            success or failure. 
        - All possible names:
            - imports
            - require
            - include
            - source
            - using
            - use
            
    - fast print via output buffer. 
    (should print very fast because not printing anything until x seconds)
        - print to the output buffer. 
        - print every __ seconds
        - pt.ex should print anything remaining in the buffer just before exit.  
        - Class stuff: 
            - properties: 
                - time_last_print?
                - output buffer
            - pt or UTI class code:
                - output_buffer = io.StringIO()
                - last_print_time = time.time()
        - pt code:
            current_time = time.time()
            if current_time - pt.last_print_time >= 4:
                pt.c("Buffer content: ")
                print(pt.output_buffer.getvalue())
                pt.output_buffer.seek(0)
                pt.output_buffer.truncate(0)  # Clear the buffer
                pt.last_print_time = current_time
        - pt.ex code:
            print(pt.output_buffer.getvalue())
            pt.output_buffer.seek(0)
            pt.output_buffer.truncate(0)  # Clear the buffer
            sys.exit
            
    - pt.timeall()
        - VERSUS / multi args: 
            - allow multiple functions to go "versus" each other:
            - Allow infinite functions as arguments. Place functions back to back, in their own pt.t() code blocks, but testing each one after the other
                This is different than the traditional means of running each function you want to test in it's own timeit() or timeall() separately. 
                (that can lead to errors because of when your machine started/stopped etc.)
    - pt.t() - organization
        - Reorganize with some functions (I am now accounting for time, so it's okay to use them)
    - pt.TimeAll ease of use improvement:
        (inspired by thinking about being even more user friendly than timeit)
        - Dynamically adjusts itself to iterate based on how long the first iteration took.
            - Default: 1 second worth of iterations, or 500, whichever is fastest. 
            - Multi-functions: Adds an additional second of iterations per function, if they haven't reached 7 iterations yet .
            - Minimum: 7 iterations (all functions inside an iteration) regardless of time to take (except user can set their own amount obviously).  
            - warns the user about the estimated time remaining. 
            - option to cancel the loops early. 
            - MORE THAN ONE FUNCTION:
    - pt.Timeall efficiency:   
        - consider getting ride of pt.t()
            and just using time.perfcounter to 
            actually print the results in about the 
            actual same time it took to run the function. 
        
    - pt() & pt.t() ACCOUNTING FOR TIME::
        - New method: use a wrapper around every class that I want to measure it's time from the calling of it to the return and everything in between entirely!!!
        - Got the idea from gpt4 on perplexity/phind
        - NOTE - It's a good solution, but I'm not accounting for the time of the wrapper.... Maybe time the creation
        of a single wrapper, and use that as a baseline. Then all other functions I'll have an exact number to use, 
        as they will be measured precisely. The only variable will be the singular wrapper for each function that is called. 
        - Code:
            import functools

            def timer(func):
                @functools.wraps(func)
                def wrapper_timer(*args, **kwargs):
                    tic = time.perf_counter()
                    value = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    toc = time.perf_counter()
                    elapsed_time = toc - tic
                    print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time:0.4f} seconds")
                    return value
                return wrapper_timer
            realpython.com

            Now, add the @timer decorator to the function you want to measure:

            @timer
            def my_func():
                # Your function implementation here
                pass
                
        - After getting the value, add it to the appropriate dict.
    - print_tricks: ACCOUNTING FOR TIME.
        - All functions can account for their time just like pt.t() and pt() do.
            - For now, can just add the same time counter at beginning and end of all functions.
            - The variable should live in UTI (because it is there first), and then all uti & pt classes can use it.
            - Eventually find a better way to account for this automatically (inheritance?)
        - Change my pt.disable message to state something like:
            "Delete python print() statements when profiling/measuring the performance of your code."
            "All print_tricks code delete's it's own time taken when profiling with pt.t() or pt.timeall() functions."
            "So you do not need to disable these to profile/meausure your code."
    - Beautiful Colors:
        Spend AS MUCH TIME ON THIS AS I NEED: These can provide helpful screenshots for demoing how this works.
        - Test colors against the black terminal.
        - Set default colors to those that are readable in a completely black terminal
        - Secondly, colors that look the best between both dark and light backgrounds.



    - Major refactor before public release (major AI help use?)
        - Go through and document what each of my function's capabilities are. 
            - Do this as a separate document, outside of docstrings etc. 
            - Let AI start the docstrings for each function as a nice write-up start. specify that I want it to
            explain the capabilities, not what individual liens do. Then I go through
              and make sure it's inline with what my functions capabilities are from my previous document.
              Change/edit everything. Then once it's done, have ai re-do the writing through some alternative
              ai chat app. Then make it how I want. 
        - make all var names snake case
        - Don't let AI insert comments into what each part of my code is doing. Leave my own comments intact, and
        in the format they are currently in (### to explain something below, like a block of code,
        ## to explain something on the same line, # to be a commented out code line)
        - Major refactor, focusing on speed over everything else.

            pt(13242): 13242 - int
        - eliminate the var in this case. Should print as:

                if pt.r(loops=4)
                    pt.ex() ## THIS WILL NEVER BE CALLED
    - pt() - errors with 'pt' in code:
        - The following will print the "disable_pt_prints" to "disable_m_prints"
        pt.timeall(Test_Func, disable_pt_prints=True)
        - I need to have it ignore things that are inside the inner parenthesis
    - pt() - Redo:
        - I think to mitigate the errors of it not printing 'pt' sometimes, 
        I need to redo some of the code: 
            - I get the first pt statement and save it as the function_call
            , then I print every other version of that word that I find, unchanged (because these
            would be inside of the inner parenthesis).
    - pt.e() - errors when using it in a thread or thread-like (ursina button):
        "b =-button()
        b.on_click = pt.ex "
        - This will crash the traceback. 
        - my code is reliant on finding the '()' within the traceback. If it is not there, then it can't be found.... bypass this. 
    - pt.h() - Args/kwargs not working:
        - Add ability for args, kwaargs etc. cause not working right now. I can't even get them to work for normal threading module on it's own. 
            - See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47733928/passing-args-or-kwargs-into-threading-thread for how to pass args and kwargs into a thread
        - Step by step:
            - find out how to pass the args/kwargs with like a comma or something after one of them.
            - I should put paremeters into pt.h() that match the threading.thread keyword arguments just like I did for PT and print() that had 5 keyword arguments for that. 
    - Pt() - Fix error in fast _simple_trace:
        - I currently have this loading up a stack at 2, but this is idle
        I need it to load dynamically. The problem is that all of the 
        code is created where it changes the pt.new_trace_level -=1
        But now I'm reading the file contents forward in time.
        So I must change all of the -=1 and +=1 to their reverses, 
        and ensure that I start at 2 / reset at 2 (I think), or perhaps 3???
    """
TODO_LONG_TERM = """
    (todolongterm todo long term todo longterm)

    - pt(tag='') / pt.save('') / pt.print_previous
        Goal: I an type out a long list of things to pt() print wherever in my code, later
        on ,I don't have to type out the whole thing again to print the same data. 
        
        - pt('var', tag=)
            - saves the args from this. Not the final print statement, just the args/
                arg names used. 
        - pt.save('')
            - same as pt(tag='default') 
                -This is like a quick/resuse option. 
        - pt.print_previous('aba')
            - Get the state of the locals/globals from the previous frame. 
            - find the args that I had saved previously
            - print their state. 
        - pt(print_tag='aba')
            - Same as pt.print_previous('aba')
    
    - pt.glob
        - To do the equivalent of a quick import or global variable but from file to file. 
        - We assign it inide of the pt or uti class vars as a dict. Looks something like this:
            ta = pt.glob(ta='..\\temp_assets\\')
    - pt.speedup()
        - They are currently located in I:\.PythonProjects\PrintTricks\z_pt_tests\ (the AST stuff)
            - AST 1-3 _speed_tests ("AST1_speed_test") are for rapidly testing different code concepts. 
            They are just placeholders for the tests. 
        - use the same concept in the profiler code: the import statement for the speedup will copy the file it is in, edit all of the pt statements to include line numbers, then at the very end, include a PT.ex() to ensure that the original file never runs.
        - use class Modify_this_file_here:
            - instead of my previous idea of stopping their code, then running my code in their place, instead we stop their code from running, modify their
            file in place, and then run the modified file. So everytime they run, it'll be appending the lines with the line_no. 
            - I don't think their original python file will actually change. Just the AST will change before it gets off to be interpreted. 
        - Easiest FASTEST speedup for all of PT:
            - Now that I know there was an IC() library, I want mine to continue on the path I started and really hone in on my things I do great on:
            - Put in-place directly in here in it's own class. re-write the entire class so that I can understand everything and have full control over every aspect, and can help solve problems if problems arise. 
            - starting up the fast pt printing:
                - 'from print_tricks import pt, speedup
                - speedup will start the process of reading the user's file in whatever file called the pt statement. 
                - will look for all statements on each line, will find the next instance of "pt_line_no" and will auto-edit it to be the correct line no. 
                - All pt _information is stored in a dictionary with line number determining it's status. 
                - try to put the pt statements into some sort of buffer for quicker printing? 
                    - Of course, strings are immutable so I can't save the entire pt statement in a buffer (with all of the colors, formatting etc) when the variables in the middle of the string might chagne. Is there another way to accomplish this? 
                - Once saved, save a hash of the file. 
                    - When user runs their app again, check the hash to see if need to change anything from last. 
                    - can I automatically do this by just looking at the .pyc file for changes??? Like, isn't python already doing this same type of thing somehow? I think yes. 
                - It saves their new file and their hash of the file. 

    - pt(dict, expand=True, expand_data=True)
        (Alias = pt.expand() / pt.data()
        - We take any existing list, dict, etc, and we simply expand it
            so that each item has it's own line (maybe using the system in pt() with
            multiple arguments)
        - Take note of how pretty print handles it. 
    - pt() - change all strings idea:
        - Have multiple strings listed in a list, just like all other vars do. 
        - Add a tag to pt that allows it to be printed in the current manner, where they are listed one after another. 

    - pt() FINISH THE very fast speed in traceback:
        - I worked on a new angle that looks like it'll be many, many times faster
            - but my profilers aren't working right...
            - I currently solved the speed issue (I think), by negating the huge call to 'traceback.extractstack()'
                It was replaced with sys._getframe(). 
            - I was able to load everything but the source code using getframe
            - So I loaded the file, and read the appropriate line to get the code
            - I further optimized it by having the file load up only once, at beginning of file
                (I may need to look into the best way of doing this)
                - I need to load the file of any file that imports print_tricks. 
                - Could probably save these files in a dict? Or just have each load one by one...
            
        - Testing:
            - Tested: 'if test_pt == true:'
        - Results:
            - print = 80ms (I changed almost all to print statements)
            - pt() _simple_trace_original = 1600ms
            - pt() _simple_trace (new) = 1600ms.....
        - Explanation:
            - I have none without profiling
        NOTE: My idea with finding all pt statements ahead of time so that I can make the pt() 
    print insanely fast and not slow down your app: I need to make sure that even if it skips
    the _simple_trace part of the statement, it still includes the new/current values of any var, 
    because the vars are supposed to change!! This is obvious but wanted to plan for it. 
    
    - pt.debugger: inside pt
        - I've failed at this before. My new thought:
            - Create a new class like "_Print_Tricks"
            - pt and... ### db both inherit from _Print_Tricks.     
        - NOTE: Will most likely fail:
            I think I know why I can't easily make this work without completely
            re-working the entire system. I want to inherit from a parent class, but unless
            each and every function is instanced from that parent class, then it won't work. 
            For example, I run pt/db but both of them access "def info():", then def info
            is not actually being a instanced method of the class, but instead is just a 
            function floating about on it's own, then it's the same function.

            - uses km modules to move click shift sometimes and maybe move mouse around slightly (though this could screw up other apps)  
    - Keyboard / Mouse Output:
        - km()
            - for doing all types of outputs in one statement.

            - Alternative:
                - Can also substitute strings instead of calls, like this:
                - km('a, b, c, hold.ctrl, wait(50), c, v, release.ctrl, /, !) 
        - km._()

        - Everything should have short name and long name. So you can do km.p() or km.press. Also can do km(p.a), or km(press.a), or km('p.a')
            -If not specified and is a button, is excpected to be a simple press. 
            - If not specified and is a mouse action, is excpected to be a click (instead of click & hold/release etc)
    - pt.prefs() - revision
        - If distributed on Pypi, have a config .toml file installed with it. 
        - If they are just grabbing the single py file all by itself, then it'll 
        dynamically create a .toml config file if/when they change the preferences. We can
        do this because if they are grabbing the file themselves, then they will be placing it
        where that user can access it. Thus they should also be able to create new config files
        from the app in that location as well. 
    - Re-Do: pt.h()
        - Consider making it easier to use my pt.h more like how you'd normally pass a function, unlike how threading.thread currently does it to pass arguments. More like passing them in a traditional way. Perhaps something like: " pt.h(function(args), daemon=True).start
            - However, the problem with altering the behavior, is that it would only make sense to do it this way if it was actually starting the thread at this exact moment. Otherside you'd say something more like gg = pt.h(function), and then later say gg.start(). So... keep analyzing and thinking about this. It might make sense to assess why you wouldn't always start the thread immediately and also how .join interacts as well and when it should be initiated. 
        " pt.h(function(args)) 
            - This would be the best, most simplest option, then if they wanted to, they could add optional arguments like this:
            " pt.h(function(args), daemon=False, join=True, start=True) 
                Which is the equivalent of:
                threading.thread(function, args=(), kwaargs=(), daemon=True).join().start() (or something like that). 
    - Exception Handling:
        - Automated Exceptions:
            - Will implement a pt.e() version of the catch-all for automated error catching. 
                - Set level of the catch to the basic pt.e/full/full_with_extra_vars etc. 
                - Also possibly allow the original version from the dude that inspired this idea with all the variables etc. OR JUST implement my own specified advanced version that shows what I want it to show. 
            - Optional - Implement as self-catching print_tricks function:
                - If possible, try to implement the auto-catcher that the guy had done, but do so with my own version and
                integrate directly into print_tricks for auto-catching
                    - NOTE: ONLY DO THIS IF I can still allow custom pt.e() exceptions with my own error messages / my
                    own assert statements. I'd still like to be able to tell the user why their thing failed. Like, what 
                    my function was expecting them to input.           
        - New Exception Enhancements:
            - Color things
            - New Options:
                - Pt.e()
                    - basic
                        - Basic with extra Vars
                    - full
                        - full with extra varsvars (do my )
                - Extra Vars:
                    - Learning from the exception handling library that included some of the other vars at that same time
                    that the exception had ocurred. 
        - Integrate my automated error catching into print_tricks itself.
            - So I no longer have to worry too much about what happens.  
            
            - Colored, Nicer looking tracebacks:
                - Consider implementing the visuals and friendliness of the following libraries:
                    - https://pypi.org/project/traceback-with-variables/
                    - https://pypi.org/project/pretty-traceback/#description
                    - https://pypi.org/project/friendly-traceback/
            - 
    - compile / speedup app / pt_compiler
        - The idea here is to automate the fastest methods of speeding up your apps IF they are easy to automate and incorporate. 
            - cython, shed_skin???, pypy? etc.
        - speedup.cython() or import speedup_cython. 
        - speedup.all() - will use all methods, test them all out, and print you back the speed results of the entire code, as well as line-by-line profiled. 
        - If someone imports a command like 'from print_tricks import compile.cython
    - speedup / fast_pt
        - options to start it multiple ways (just like with my aliasing, I'm not going to stick to the python idea of "there should only be one way")
            - can start it via import statements
            - Can start via pt.speedup() or maybe pt.speedup_pt() or maybe pt.fast_prints/fastprints
            - But if done in this manner, it still must be the first or second thing that you import into your file. 
        - Change speedup (possibly) to fast_prints/fast_pt

    - pt.t() - To Completely account for pt.t's own time: 
        - pt.t() is now a very fast and simple pointer that just goes to UTI.Timer function. 
        - Has a time.perfcounter() before and after the call to the UTI.Timer function. 
        - uses static args??? to make it faster (whatever that thing is called)
        - Time Var: It either:
            - It gets the values it needs from UTI.Timer, but then modifies the time variable 
            - Or it gets the time var on it's own right at that moment.
    - Easy refinement to callable vs type():
        - Perhaps I should change my code that says "if type is type(UTI)" to use the "if callable(variable)" code... I used the "if callable"
            in one part of my code and the 'type(UTI) in another....
            - So use whichever one will make consistent results for all of the tests. 
    - Add an optional counter option that counts how many times this identical statement has been ran
        - pt(var1, count_clones = True)
        - Now on traceback see if this line number/position has already been done before, and if so, either
        copies the original _info, or prints again, but in either case, it counts up. 
    - pt() - type enhancement:
        - When presenting a tuple, list, set, dict, array, etc:
            - If type of all vars in tuple == type of first var, then return type of first var.
                str = " - tuple of floats, Length: 187"
            - else: return 'mixed'
                str = " - tuple of mixed data, Length: 187"
    - new template for func names: NOTE: BE careful. Just because some function is designed to work with another, don't allow that to make me think that it can't also be used in all sorts of other areas. 
        - if derivitive of another func, append the name with that other func:
            - Primary func that has children will get appended with it's ending tag that is an abreviation of it's name, followed by 0, meaning "origination"
            - subsequent ones are appended with the same tag, but give numbers afterwards, hopefully in order, but it's alright if it goes out of order, as I 
            can always just "change all occurences" later. 

    - get Docstring as a variable:
        I've written about the concept of using docstrings as vars. I'm not sure exactly what I would like to do, but here's an example:
            print(eval(sys._getframe().f_code.co_name).__doc__)
    - pt.enableAfterSeconds() - unlock permanently after _ seconds, or just unlock on every seconds.
    - x = Gen Data
            Generates random data when called
            - Features:
                - Can specify a 1d array from a 2d, by specifying the dimension d1, d2 etc. 
                    - d1 = list, randData = 'strings' (like coins)
                    - d2 = list, randData = ds'floats' (like money)
                - Can specify how to pack the random data:
                    - 'single' = just a single value is returned (float, int, str, etc)
                    - 'list/tuple/dict/array' = pack the data types into this structure. 
                - Can specify types of random data:
                    - floats/ints/str's etc. 
                - Can specify the num of items to produce. 
                - Can specify any and all rounding etc. 
                - Can call out specific patterns that you'd like to produce. 
                    - Start off with simple patterns, like just ranges. And maybe ranges that alternate. 
                    - Eventually get patterns that I want to track like in trading strategies.  
                - Can optionally display a graph. 
                    - Should be as simple graph as possible. 
                    - Just display one value, statically for now. 
                    - Eventually allow, animations over time, and multiple values. 

    - pt() speed up pt statements:
        - Profile the code
            - It looks like a lot of slowdown happens with the repeated calls to _simple_trace. 
                -Could I somehow check to see if this pt call is the same as an old one and thus re-use the data, like line number, func name, file name, etc.?
                    - using hashes?
                    - Using my equivalent of sequences_dict from my pt.t and pt.w functions. But how to make that one distinguishable? Probably via hash and or line numbers... 
                        - So in order to use this, I'd have to figure out fastest way to get line numbers without using traceback.
                        - Might be able to determine if we are inside of a loop using this. See pt() determine loop for more details:      
                    - what else?
            - cython the entire pt statement?
            - cython just the print part of the pt statement? 
            - setup slots for all of my functions (slots requires me to say what args are allowed and turns off the ability for them to be dynamic with 'setattr' etc)
            - swap out print() with sys.stdout.write() - supposedly saves 10 percent of time.
            - buffering Plan:
                - if pt statements happen too quickly, then:
                    - turn buffering on
                    - set a thread that runs a while loop
                        - Loop constantly checks for last_print_time
                        - if is has been unchaged for more than ___:
                            - close stdout. 
                            - reopen stdout with buffering = 1, which I think puts it into default mode. 
    - UTI._simple_trace CURRENT PLAN:
        - use getcurrentframe - only uses 100 nanoseconds. 
        - Strip it to get out the file name, line number, and function name.
        - To get arguments:
            args, _, _, locals_ = inspect.getargvalues(frame)
            return (locals_[arg] for arg in args)
        - in total, the 7000 - 25000 nanoseconds will be down to around 700 nanoseconds!!!!!!!
            - NOTE: what are the missing values in 'args, _, _, locals' ??? 
        - Get arguments faster:
            - To further refine the argument method above:
            - i can use the getcurrentframe to string,
                - then find the line number and file name, 
                - use both of these to pull the line code from my index that would have been created already!!! wallah!
                - BETTER: The index can save the arguments themselves. Then when I need them, I can pull them with a hash from the dictionary for super fast retrieval!!!
    - pt super fast _simple_trace 3 try structure:
        - A - fastest: if we already have line number (our re-creation of the file with appended "ln=#" in the statements):
            - simple trace will take that line number and look up all other values in the dictionary. 
        - B - Very fast: If we don't already have the line number:
            - We use simple trace to just look up the line number, then we get the rest of the values from the dict. 
        - C - Slow / normal speed: if B fails in a try/catch statement for some reason:
            - We run the original Code

        Plan A How to:
            - Initiating the speedup:
                - "from print_tricks import pt, hyper_pt"
                - importing hyper_pt will tell that class to read, copy and catalogue (in a dict) the contents of the file that imported the statement
                
            - Appending for true speed:
                - Every single pt statement is then edited to include the line number that it is on. 
            - Optional speed enhancement:
                - We create an invisible hyper_pt.endloop (or a special thing like pt_helper.endLoop, and make a special class that we import into our new file)
                - code is analyzed for understanding which pt line numbers show up in repeated code. 
                - We add the .endLoop call underneath every pt statement that was located within a loop. 
                    - We buffer the statements within the loops, and de-buffer when exiting the loops
            - Final speedup through cython:
                - We auto-cythonize our new version of their code. So we took their code and made a new file of it that actually runs (with our line numbers), 
                    and we run the auto-cythonize code in it, to auto-cythonize the final end result of their own code!!! 
                - This is also optional. If desired, then we have them import like this: 
                    "from print_tricks import pt, hyper_pt, auto_cython"
                    and the auto_cython will run after the hyper_pt is done running. 
                    
            - NOTE on creating our version of their file:
                - Our version must work under all circumstances... so find out how to solve a potential problem:
                    - Possible problem: Their imports before they get to print_tricks import will have initiated things for that file that are no longer relevant, and we'll have
                    to either undo those imports, or probably best to ask the users to have print_tricks as the first in the list of imports. 
    - pt.t() wrapping calls - based on new speed up 3 try structure from above
        - So combine the idea of wrapping calls with the idea of building our own version of their code: We can now write our own code that replaces 
        their code to do any/all of the advanced stuff that we've ever wanted, like wrapping code inside of our own statements like: 
        'pt.t(func1())' or even just 'pt.t(func1)' and will run the app regardless. 
        
    - pt.t() wrapping calls:
        - Wrapping calls functionality:
            - Add functionality: wrap a call inside pt.t()
            - So instead of doing:
                pt.t(1); function() pt.t(1), 
            - We do:
                pt.t(function())
                    - The function automatically determines that if what was passed as a function, and if so it wraps it up in it's own pt.t() call.
            - How to:
                - pt.t checks if it's a function. 
                - if so, sends to UTI._timerWrapped()
                - (see _timerWrapped Tests below to get an idea of how to actually pull it off). 
            - parameter: numLoops:
                - if numLoops > 1(default), 
                    - run the function multiple times in sequence, and then
                    - get average of the time of each result
                    - display the result:
                        "With __ loops, in milliseconds, Average: __ms, best: __ms, worst: __ms"
        - _timerWrapped (test A - exec code):
            - We write _timerWrapped(func(x)) in testFile. 
                - funcX will run as normal, but then we will be inside of _timerWrapped. 
                - print_tricks processing:
                    - import the file that _timerWrapped was called in. 
                    - Access it's global variables for that namesspace (the imported file's namespace), 
                    - Get the function definition/code of the func that timeWrapped called. 
                    - Dynamically run this:
                        | pt.t('a')
                        | for i in range(numLoops)
                            exec(funcCode, importedGlobals)
                        | timeTaken = pt.t('a')
                        | return timeTaken
                    - Now we subtract the first 'a' from the last, then divide
        - _timerWrapped (test B - bytecode):
        - _timerWrapped (test C - replace live file):
                    
    - pt.loops():
        - Basically have a method to convert incoming data into numpy computations. The goal is to take the complexity out of numpy and make it easier to access with my loops. 
        My pt.loop can either automatically determine how to convert it to the appropriate numpy situation or you manually specify what type you are doing, and it does the background
        stuff for you. 
        
    - Fast FTD - Find, Fast Trace, dict the whole file(s) - Structure A
        - Check if this current py file has been changed/modified either with:
            - 1 - Via "if modified" via some sys call or os call or something (this might not work, as file might be "modified" after saving without channging any codes). 
            - 2- via a hash that checks if hash has changed. 
            
        - Load file, 
        - Create 2 dicts of file:
            - 1st: First Contact Dict:
                - We just grab the keys from top to bottom, in the original line number order. 
                - Keys are either:
                    - Line numbers for either:
                        - Line numbers for whole file
                        - Line numbers for just when pt statements are called. 
            - 2nd: inOrder Dict
                - We now go through the code and get the order that each statement will be called. (functions calling other functions etc). 
                - We create second dict with the keys being the order at which each statement will be called. 
                - Values are:
                    - a tupple with:
                        - line this statement shows up on (we get this from the previous "first sight" dict). 
                        - num times pt shows up in this line
                        - "code" for the line
                        - Num of args
                        - tuple of it's args names.
                        - function / class / module this appears inside of. 
                        - Is Looped? Is the function it's inside of a loop? 
                        - file Name
                            - or.. to save space: 
                                a number that refers to where to find this file_name in another dictionary. 
                                - So we create a file_name reference dict that stores each key (1-n), and it's value is whatever the file_name is. 
                                    - So in our dict that shows values, we will just have a 1 or something in the file_name slot, and that will lookup what the #1 key is
                                    and get it's file_name value. 
                        - last value of each of it's args. 
                            - We test the current line number, arg names and then values. 
                                - if the value hasn't changed, then we shortcut the rest of the entire code and paste the saved results.
                        - saved results from the last time this code was ran
                            - this is like the final compiled print_str or whatever. 
                            - We use this to bypass the needing to re-do the code, because if it's the same code (same call, same args, same line), and the values of those args
                            also haven't changed, then the results will be identical. 
            - (move) getting statements in the correct order:
                - prep:
                    - Names: get all Class and function names.
                    - indent level: find the indention of each class by checking it's current spacing and then check the spacing of it's next item in the line. 
                        - use this knowledge to Get each class and function starting and ending line numbers.
                - 'pt(' check: 
                    - when looking for pt statements )    
        - When first pt function is called:
            - Run a real stacktrace to get the current line number/values etc. 
                - We initialize our Fast-Trace Dict and place our position on exactly the line that the stack trace had predicted. 
            Or...
            - On import, We eval the entire code and see which pt statements is called and in what order. 
                                    
        - Whenever any pt statement or func is called:
            - Run a function to guess the current position. 
                - Function increments it's count by 1 and moves itself down to the likely next dictionary item for the next time a pt statement comes up).
                - When this predicted item is located within a loop, we will auto-turn on the print buffering. And then exit when the loop exits (the next pt statement comes through)
            - Prediction fails:
                - If we guess wrong, we simply call a real traceback.  (when we are likely to fail)
                - When we are likely to guess wrong:
                    - when a loop ends..
                        - If the statement inside and outside of the loop are different, then no problem. But if they happen to be the same, we will likely be wrong. 
                    - Possibly when there are lots of embedded pt statements. 
                    - When there are 'pt('  in the code but are not part of the program (commented out, or function declarations etc.)
                    - within an if/else, try/catch. 
                        - When pt is within these, mark pt dict as "unsure" but still place it in the right spot. Now if the next predicted line doesn't match up,
                        the ai will just run a real stacktrace to determine where we are at. 
                    - commented out code (until I account for this)        
            - Guessing:
                1 - We are at the next item (key) in the list, because we are keeping track of our location. 
                2 - It has the same code as the item that is supposed to be here. 
        - find any functions that are called that ARE NOT in current file.
            - Get their function code and then:
                - Look through it for pt calls. If found:
                    - Look for "import print_tricks or from print_tricks import' etc. 
                        - If found, load that entire file as well. 
        
        - Does python have it's own dict already with all file contents, line by line? ??
    - Fast FTD (Find/Trace/Dict) - structure B
        New take on the structure (will continue to change)
        - Whole Dict:
            - First scan of files creates the whole dict, line by line.
            - Mark where every structure exists:
                - Functions, classes, if/else, try/except, and loops, commented hashtag lines, and commented triple quote lines are located (start and ending lines). 
                - Mark lines where function calls & class instantiation are located.
                    - Mark if any function call in any line points to a class/function not in this file (an import), not including built-ins (for scanning for 
                    pt statements later). 
        - pt dict:
            - is 'pt(' in line?
                - Is line number?:
                    - Within the bounds of any structure in the "Whole" dict?
                        -if so, mark that pt statement line as "inside callable" or inside "if", "try", "loop", etc. 
                            - if inside a callable, mark what function will call it. 
    - Fast FTD Potential:
        - Speed:
            - just by pre-building the "traceback", we can eliminate around 98 prct of the speed drop between print() and pt()
            - If we further optimized _bytes_size() code, we can eliminate another .5 - 1 prct or so. 
                - One optimization: don't run every time:
                    - Only run if it's a collection (list, dict, set etc), or if it's a string/flt/int that has a length greater than 5000 or something. 
        - sets up the ability to modify code in real time (add print statements, slowdowns, checks, @decorators etc).                   
    - pt.determine_if_inside_loop() 
        (for things like auto-turning on stdout buffering)
        - We could actually regex scan the whole file that any pt call is in, 
            - add each file to a dictionary of files,
            - get all lines where pt statements are located. 
            - get the code of each line : 'pt.t(1)'
            - go up the file from that pt() statement to see if we are inside of a function or a type of loop. 
                - record if in either function or loop. 
                - if in function, now search to see if that function ever shows up in a loop.  

    - pt.backupFile():
        - Running this command will copy the current file that we are in, 
            - Then look for the version # in the file, then append that to the name
            - Append the date/time to the name. 
            - optionally create a second file called "print_tricks_debug" that I import as pt_d. 
    - @autocompile / cython:
        - Incorporate this super easy/straightforward for now. 
        - Eventually, find out best ways/options to incorporate this so that I can call it on just single functions or I can call it on blocks of code or entire files. 
        - When adding the ability for annotate=True (for generating the html code): I need to add some code. 
            - Original Code in AutoCompile __init__.py:
                - cythonized_func = cython_inline(cython_function_code, cython_compiler_directives={
                    "infer_types": self.infer_types,})
            - New code that I need to add for html:
                import Cython.Compiler.Options
                Cython.Compiler.Options.annotate = True
                cythonized_func = cython_inline(cython_function_code, cython_compiler_directives={
                    "infer_types": self.infer_types,}, annotate=True)                 
    - Logging:
        -Allow the transition from pt statements into logging statements for production-ready code. 
        - Look into various logging libraries. 
            - (just one to look into) https://pypi.org/project/loguru/#files
            - Check out other libraries. Find one that I can incorporate or just make one myself.            
    - pt.runSpeed()
        - This is basically slow-motion control. slowmo slow motion
        - Copy the update loop system from Ursina. 
        - parameters:
            - num 0-1.0
                - 1 = fastest speed, 0+ is the percentage of normal speed.
            - If no num: "pt.runSpeed()"
                - Set runspeed back to 1.0
        - Ideas on how to do it:
            - Best idea: Use ursina's update class/function. 
                - Find out how it's coded and copy it into my own pt class. 
            - eval lines:
                - create new code that runs this file, but puts each line into eval mode with a time delay between each. 
            - severely restrict cpu speed:
                - restrict it but monitor it, make sure the file is still running at the speed that I'd like and adjust cpu time to accomodate...
                    - but it might be too hard to adjust.  
                    - wasn't a
            - continually limit and then allow cpu time in:
                I can't "limit" the amount of cpu usage, but I can limit the amount of time that an app is allowed to run so.... :
                    - I can simply have a loop (probs don't need another thread), that limits cpu time to like .05 seconds and then sleeps for the remaineder, and then 
                    resets the time and allows it to run once again. 
                        - So it's basically constantly pauses on set increments throughout the code = "slow mo" / precise time control mode!!!!
    - pt().disable / remove pt code:
        - I've created the pt.disable to quick-disable pt functions... But that's just for now. 
        - Feature to comment out all relevant pt code lines (by using in-place) 
        - convert all pt functions to log statements. At least for now, not by actually editing the code, but instead by having an if statement that says if production-state (or non-development mode), then redirects this statement to the logging module that I have. 
        - New description for advertising general print_tricks pt concept:
            - Do you want your print statements to be easier to write and give you far more _information? 
            - Or do you want the power of logging with the simplicity of a simple print line?
            - Not only can this do all these things, but when sending your code out for production, you can automatically redirect your print statements to the logging module for professional ready code!!!
    - d delete New features:
        - Focus on specialty of deleting print statements. Using a modifier of * within the statement, we can say "delete all like this: UTI._info(*)"
    - pt.pt
        -Include categories, not just generic help
        -Use DocStrings
    - pt.tut() - tutorial for the module. Make people good at it almost instantly. 
        - First time users check (first time they use any function, tell them it looks like their first time and ask them if they'd like to run the tutorial)
        - Tutorial that is fast, efficient, and as affective as I can make it. So each "page" should be short while still having all effective _information.
            -Each "page":
                - General guidelines
                - Examples of usages
            - Have forward/backward keys
    ? = Current State of variables
            - Displays all variable names and values at this current place in time. Also displays the current function. 
            - Defaults to Local variables, but has an optional argument for global variables as well. 
    f = Find
            - Searches through all of your files in or around your current directory to look for stuff.
            - Is this necessary at all? I have Ctrl+sh+F in VsCode to look through all files.... 
                -But not all IDE's may be able to search through all files on your pc. 
    - sshKeyboard
        - Look into this. Cross platform, covers everything. But single-presses only, unfortunately. 
            https://pypi.org/project/sshkeyboard/
        - Not needed for this project but probs for some others. 
    - pt(non-existing variable)
        NOTE: Only use this IF we have the ability to scan a document for pt statements before hand. I've been developing
        that ability, but I don't when when/if it will be ready (was developing so that I could pre-figure out which statements
        were repeated lines, and then basically make the print statements super duper fast)
            - I tried getting this to work otherwise, and it won't, as it triggers an automated error response from python
            directly, bypassing my function, even before it's called. Probably because it has to take the var name and pass it 
            into my pt(varName) function, but python is unable to pass the name because it doesn't exist.
            - Solution: Scan for vars that don't exist, and assign them to a special name of type of "unknown class". 
                Then it'll act like normal within the app, and when it gets that undefined var, it'll trigger what to do
                when the string says "<<ptunknown_98987987pt>> or is type "unknown class"
        ORIGINAL IDEA:
        - print(l;kj) & pt(l;kj) = printing a var that doesn't exist will cause a crash. You can put that print statement into a try/catch block, but why let it crash your program to begin with? 
        - We can make pt take the unknown, print that the var doesn't exist, and then display the original statement just like we do for everything else:
            <<<error>>> - pt(l;kj) - <<<<l;kj doesn't exist>>> -  (Line: 4, @function, @file)
            - possibly try/catch wherever that var would throw an error within print_tricks.py
            - convert the var to a string
            - run the normal stuff on it like all of my other stuff with traceback support, etc. 

    - Possible new/edited pt functions:
        Pt.h
        -threading (for io heavy functions)
        Pt.m
        -multiprocessing (for CPU functions)
        Pt.a 
        - async (when to use this?)
        Pt.hq
            -queues to get continuous return values from threads

        Pt.___
            - an intelligent function where you pass your function and arguments and it will analyze then (probably run them) and find out if they are io bound, CPU bound etc.
            - possibly tests each function in each of the different processing methods above and records their performance, then recommends which one for which function. 
                - possibly have a simple command like pt. Test speed efficiency that uses in place to place decorators in front of all code and tests them, then swaps out the decorator for different type of processing methods. Best results get saved/recommended. 

        This could be huge, if it works in a whole app, or at least in a whole module, and we could record the results, and potentially safe people is tremendous amount of time. And advertise this as another speed method for python.

        To save time, couldn't we make most of the modules become c code via nuitka, and then call them all via another python file, but calls them a separate threads or separate processes, that way the python gil isn't locked?
            
    - pt.size():
        - Error:
            - Some classes appear to be accurately, recursively found (data size), while
            others are horribly off, and appear to get the entire memory footprint of
            the current python app at this moment in time (so everything you have
            loaded/imported to get your current app working right now). 
            - Other classes are accurate though (import gc, import math)
        - I coded it to get the number of sources that it does recursively and print
        them out but upon doing so, discovered that the function is grabbing a lot
        of code that has nothing to do with that particular data structure, and thus, 
        I don't know how accurate it actually is. Of course probably much more accurate
        than the regular python getsizeof() library... but...? 
            - For example, it's grabbing my print_tricks library and adding that to the 
            memory cost, even when I do something like pt.size(math), 
            - On that note, could it be getting the amount of memory of the entire
            app running at that moment in time???
                - if so, how do I stop it?
        - perhaps the code I have in pt.size is really just for things like objects that
        are not functions/classes/imports but things like dicts etc. 
            - Perhaps I can find if this is true?

        ## NOTE OLD METHOD to remove 'pt.______' type of text from the arguments list. Leave it here so I understand what the small line is doing below. I've move the "replace_these_words" to the print tricks main class so it only runs one time.
        ## Get arguments alone, but include original formatting (newlines, tabs, etc).
        ##   NOTE: BUG PREVENTION: Make sure all letters that need to be removed are replaced before replacing the symbols. Otherwise, we will be creating new words: For example, I was removing the '(' before removing the pt. so what was happening is the code was removing the '(' first and the 'pt(self...)' was becoming 'ptsself...', which it then removed the pts, which means that the s on self was eliminated.
        ##   So: letters first:
        # replace_these_words = (
        #                         'pt.delete',
        #                         'pt.ex',
        #                         'pt.l',
        #                         'pt.prefs',
        #                         'pt.props',
        #                         'pt.properties',
        #                         'pt.p',
        #                         'pt.t',

        #                         '(') ### NOTE '(' must be last and 'pt' must be 2nd to last or else it'll delete the 'pt' in front of anything else that I'm trying to replace and it'll fail to replace it. Like if i did 'pt' in front of 'pt.p', then i'd just end up with '.p' and it'd fail.

                - print_tricks processing:
                    - import the file that _timerWrapped was called in.
                    - Access it's global variables for that namesspace (the imported file's namespace),
                    - Get the function definition/code of the func that timeWrapped called.
                    - Dynamically run this:
                        | pt.t('a')
                        | for i in range(numLoops)

        - New:
            - I just need to be able to set the namespace to the other module.
            Find a function online that will allow me to set the namespace or change the namespace.
                - I can then "inject" whatever code I want into the other file, at the location that I want. So basically, I'll be
                injecting my code just after their call of pt.timerWrap(func(x)), and my code will just be a copy of theirs but
                with my pt.t() statements before and after it, and a for loop, whether this is actually part of the injected code
                or this code lies just before and after the exec() statements within the def timerWrap
        - Running as a string:
            - if the user wraps their code to call their func within my pt.timerWrap() statement, then it'll run it as normal, and then
            mine will run a second time (or as many times as specified). Which means that their timing will be less accurate as their code
            is running twice now (and might have repeated print statements etc).
            - But if the user instead puts their call as a string, then my code can run indpendently of their code.... however, wouldn't
            this still take up the extra time, so I'm not sure if it's worth it. But it's probably safer overall to run it as a string, but
            I also like the idea of trying to allow it as a straight up passed function.
                - Or... what if.. I had it called just like you call threading.thread with the args passed separately from the
                assignment. So it'd look like this: pt.timerWrap(func, args=x). So now their function wouldn't be called here, but
                would rather be called inside of my timerWrap code whenever I was ready to do it.
                    - This would be very similar to the idea of just placing the "func(x)" in a string though, and I think maybe a lot more
                    straightforward. And..
                    It would also allow me to run the code just once, and still get them a return value on their code. So perhaps
                    passing as a string truly is the best approach, for easines to understand, good returns, control over the code
                    etc. NOTE: As stated above, Passing as a string should probably be the best default behavior for now.

        - If the function code that I have gathered calls other functions/modules within it... how could this be handled?
            - If it had imports, I'd have to also call the imports into this namespace.
            - If it was just another function, I'd have to search for ALL code within that function code and separate out the args, get the
            func all by itself, find the vars that pass to it, and then run that code as well... So basically I'd be not only recreating the
            procedure that I used to build the first function, but do this __ number of times (automatically), but I'd basically be creating
            a customized, re-done version of their entire app/codebase (potentially).
                - Although there are likely many benefits to this (like finding optimum code, finding code that's never ran/touched),
                I doubt it'd be better than some of the other techniques I can use:
                    - Probably better methods:
                        - 1 - running an import code that analyzes the code, looking for the statements, and then builds another file on top and
                        runs that one instead
                        - 2 - Running this code but doing so in the other namespace somehow. (probably the easiest by far).

                                a number that refers to where to find this file_name in another dictionary. 
                                - So we create a file_name reference dict that stores each key (1-n), and it's value is whatever the file_name is. 
                                    - So in our dict that shows values, we will just have a 1 or something in the file_name slot, and that will lookup what the #1 key is

                            - this is like the final compiled print_str or whatever.

                            also haven't changed, then the results will be identical.
